I was in Guatemala Airport at the beginning of 08/05. The airport from the outside is certainly an interesting '60s building if not well maintained. Arrivals is good the lines are quick but the taxi/bus/hire car/hotel desks are before you leave the building and you have to beg and plead to be allowed back in again (without taking luggage)! Departures are good the lines quick people friendly lots of shops to buy last minute tourist tat duty free and Guatemalan fast food (well worth it when you are flying AA to BOS via MIA without even a chance of buying food!). Overall a reasonable experience for a poor country! I especially liked the No dogs and No guns notices on the entrance doors!,2021-09-10,23:52:50,Ulla-Britt Johansson,adahlberg@holmgren.se,04556806792
US pre-clearance was fast and staff were efficient unlike many other airports I have visited. Terminal 2 looks very modern and although big it is easy to navigate. A large variety of cafes and stores were available and the airport was spotless. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit.,2021-09-19,21:48:02,Maria Karlsson,vblomqvist@yahoo.de,02281755840
Eat before you go to the airport. The food outlets offer items that were packaged during the Reagan administration! Terminal A (Southwest/America West) is extremely narrow! Terminal B (American/Alaska/Delta/United) is quite efficient,2021-09-11,19:45:28,Maria Carlsson,maurice60@yahoo.de,+919216788123
Arrived Terminal 2 at 2.00 am after 3 hours flight delay. When we entered had to wait 1 hr for eye scan then another 40 minutes for immigration. Terminal 2 is small to carry a large number of flights. On the way back again have to face a long check-in line although check-in was quite fast. Inside the departure lounge there are limited number of restaurants but overall is a good experience.,2021-09-30,15:43:18,Marie Hermansson,chiragthakur@bumb.info,0924635754
In August 2013 I transited through T3 Dubai Airport from Johannesburg to the UK and back. My connections were 2hrs on the way their and 4hrs on the way back. Queues at transit security moved quite fast. Used the train from terminal A to B easy to use and very efficient. Airport is very clean well sign aged no problems to get to my departures gates.,2021-09-29,03:42:45,Olaf Zänker,schombergesche@gmx.de,036-336 64 55
I connected for the first time in DTW with NWA. As previously mentioned the McNamara terminal is indeed VERY long. However it does have moving-steps and alas: its own metro system (with red trams like NWA's planes) - with tram stops along the way. Also the terminal is immaculately kept with a clean decor and floor to ceiling windows throughout. Add a wide array of dining and shopping options and you've got an award-winning product. Definitely better than ATL and even better than the pleasant Delta terminal in CVG.,2021-10-09,07:13:03,Lena Karlsson,aina95@googlemail.com,01021 426290
"Visited Cairo for a conference at a glance during arrival the airport seemed ok clean not at all crowded Immigration was a breeze with only 1 counter operating out of about 30 counters toilets were clean and I was out of the airport in about 30 min. The real problem started when I was departing. Be prepared to get tired of hearing the word ""baaksheesh"" which means a tip. Every person you see shall approach you for a tip even if it is their duty. The airport doesn't offer free drinking water facilities you have to buy it. Announcements were excellent and they went the extra mile to announce in the language of the destination for International Flights.",2021-09-13,11:11:16,Sigvard Nilsson,mauderiksson@yahoo.de,00261535826
"Changed planes in DUB a couple days ago. Upon landing it was very interesting to see grazing sheep cows and old farm cottages just beyond the airport perimeter fence instead of ugly industrial parks. T2 looks elegant clean and modern very impressive. Arrived from the US but had to clear immigration and ""enter"" Ireland in order to obtain connecting boarding pass to Dubai which was strange. All the airport staff were polite and courteous (including the local traveling public). The sole exception were the Polish women staffing the Emirates airline check-in counters who were extremely unfriendly and rude. Prices for food at the terminal were extremely high - comparable to Japan - so I did not buy anything. I wonder if main-street prices in Ireland are also this high? All in all transiting through T2 gives a very favourable impression of Ireland to the visitor and inspires one to pay a visit to this country.",2021-09-30,19:40:43,Christian Månsson,peter97@live.se,+49 (0) 5724 677060
Airport is great for tourist travel but poor for business. No fast track through security. Business lounge is small and poorly kept (dirty drinking glasses poor availability of food dirty tables).

I travel frequently to Copenhagen with two small children to visit family and despite the nice shops and interior this is eaily the worst airport I have ever been to with kids. As the only airport I have ever encountered staff do not allow through security small foldable buggies built for airport travel. They claim the union wont allow staff to carry them down the stairs by the aircraft. Travelling as a single parent with a 10months and two year old trying to manage from check-in to the plane is a true nightmare and staff does not offer any help but feel righteous as they simply follow rules. Dreadful and shameful!,2021-10-07,22:38:06,Dipl.-Ing. Jens-Peter Kambs,margaretahenriksson@googlemail.com,2373411880
A mixed experience. Arrival very easy and quick. Departure rather stressful. Have to fight through crowds lines for check-in passport control rather confusing and disorganized as was security and not convinced how serious it was - there is secondary gate screening which is good. In the main terminal one shared lounge (except for Qatar Airways) as far as I could see and a couple of places to eat.,2021-09-27,22:43:32,Birgitta Larsson,gpeukert@web.de,0583699329
"Cebu Mactan is one of the better airports I have used. The staff are pleasant in all situations that may arise and extremely helpful. I see derogatory comments on here about the cleanliness Cebu airport from English travelers, they should look at their own airports first before commenting, most airports in UK are filthy especially Heathrow. Cebu is one of the most pleasant travel experiences you could wish for after a long haul flight, or of course the beginning of one. I would agree there are a lack of restaurants but this is a comparatively small international airport that is gradually growing.

Allow an hour to check your car back as the lazy staff are not around to meet you and you get to wander around the spacious hot car park with your keys. On finding them they don't show ID so you could be giving the keys to anyone. The airport's fine small and laid-back. We didn't have time to see Faro thanks to this problem. It wouldn't kill anyone to have a mobile number for the rental car reps,2021-10-05,11:09:21,Annette Rohleder-Austermühle,hugo21@ring.de,+49 (0) 1711 690696
Arrived from Singapore with Qatar Airways and into the new terminal. Seemed to be the only flight around so was quickly through the VOA and immigration but despite the lack of other flights baggage took an eternity to arrive. Departure was an absolute joke. Huge queues to even get into the terminal and the first security check. Then check in. Then another queue for a further security check then departure tax and a final queue for immigration. Limited staff on departure tax and immigration. Then the biggest frustration is that there's almost nothing in the way of facilities or restaurants available. The so called business class lounge was very poor. Quite clearly the airport just isn't finished yet. Why they didn't wait I just don't know. Overall a poor experience and worse than the old airport if I'm honest.,2021-09-21,14:54:08,Jhanvi Contractor,ujohansson@swipnet.se,+46 (0)665 759 93
We just transited through here on our way to Amman and found the experience much less stressful than we had expected. By the time we disembarked from our first flight our next flight was already boarding but the flight attendants assured us it would be fine. The longest part was the bus ride as we flew J class to Doha and then were flying Economy to Amman so the bus first dropped the continuing J class passengers at the Premium Terminal before going to Arrivals and finally to the Transfer terminal. Once inside I was pleasantly surprised. The security check lines were moving very quickly and in about 10 minutes we were at the gate ready to board the bus.,2021-09-30,00:00:05,Andreas Johansson,gardeira@yahoo.com,06670132818

Flew out of here to Gatwick. Overall airport is not great and having had to drop our car off early and then a four hour wait meant we ended up using the airport cafe and snack bar. All I can say is what an absolute rip-off - 7 Euros for a coke and a peppermint tea 3.60 Euros for an ice cream lollipop. The food was equally expensive and tasteless. It might be slightly less galling if the surroundings were pleasant but they aren't - no air conditioning and dirty tables. Corfu is a lovely place but the airport really lets it down.,2021-10-09,01:04:33,Prof. Yasmin Franke MBA.,beatewinkler@binner.de,0526693367
"Just flew home to O'Hare yesterday afternoon. The customs experience was fine using the kiosks. But then you must deal with people. A woman shouted at me to go to number 43! I looked at that station and there was a man there with no passengers so I went straight to his booth. He screamed at me ""I did not call you"". I picked up my passport and papers and began to retreat at which point he said ""Come here!"" I told him the woman had directed me to his booth but he said again ""I did not call you!"" He then began to ask me a series of questions in a loud angry tone. Welcome home to Chicago!",2021-09-29,23:15:28,Indranil Boase,stephanie07@hotmail.de,+46 (0)8 271 176 28

Transited BRU earlier this month. Total chaos. Landed from MXP in terminal B long walk to terminal A for connecting flight to PHL. Passport control not bad but as heading up stairs to get to security was faced with a sea of people coming down the stairs. Seems main security checkpoint was overloaded and they were directing people to use alternate at far end of A terminal. Had to walk to end of terminal where there was a mass of people queuing for 2 checkpoints. 45 minutes through then up to departures and back to the other end of the terminal to the gate. Very little to look at air side no food nor shopping this was mainly pre security as was duty free kiosk so could not get that stamped forfeiting the refund.

I use both Edinburgh and London City airports regularly and I used to consider them my favourites. Due to the new security processes introduced at both (they are owned by the same company) I am now beginning to hate travelling through them. Whoever thought the new security arrangements were a good idea was wrong wrong wrong. It is longer less efficient more frustrating than ever. At Edinburgh in particular it really makes passenger feel like cattle being herded. Truly awful experience - they should revert back to the old system.,2021-09-20,11:31:17,Arhaan Barad,neelofarsrivastava@hotmail.com,+49 (0) 4382 651606
Don't expect too much of this little airport but it is friendly and the departures lounge has expanded recently. At one time the only facilities were the toilets once you were through the security but now there is a vending machine for soft drinks and chocolate etc. The restaurant (upstairs) has a good menu and they are fully aware of the flight times so you don't have to wait for hours for your meal. There is one small shop (outside the security check area) which doesn't help if you want to take those items through with you that are ordinarily banned. The security staff also apply an interesting interpretation on what is dangerous: we had a travel iron confiscated from our hand luggage as it could be used as a blunt instrument. On the way back we could have bought one at Stansted - presumably traveling from the UK we weren't likely to brain anyone with it.,2021-10-06,08:37:35,Mannat Shankar,ivig@kannan.com,02053379585
"Mactan-Cebu International Airport (CEB) is a much better entry point to the Philippines than Ninoy Aquino (unless your final destination is Manila of course). However despite the fact that Cebu is the second-largest city in the Philippines there is nothing overly impressive about its airport. I arrived at CEB on a domestic flight and was quite surprised how desolate the terminal was. This was in stark contrast to what was waiting just outside. For a flight of 60 or so people it seemed like the whole city of Cebu was waiting to greet us in the ""welcoming area"". I stuck out like a sore thumb being the only Cacuasian around but never once felt threatened by the smiling faces of Filipinos. I was immediately greeted by a sonata of sales pitches as taxi reps competed for my business. I gently waved them off since I was waiting to meet my friend. They were persistent but not obnoxious. The availability of transportation is not a problem at CEB but you will need to learn the art of negotiation to avoid being charged unfairly. Thankfully my friend is quite skilled in these matters and we never had to pay an elevated fare. A few weeks later I left from the international terminal at CEB for a flight to HKG. I don't remember much about my actual impressions of this terminal since I was contemplating a heartbreaking goodbye to my friend. However I do remember that the security line was not long at all and the entire process of getting my boarding pass and clearing customs took about 15 minutes max. The airport workers were quite friendly except of course for the customs official. CEB is a utilitarian airport and nothing more. It helps you get around the Philippines and S.E. Asia but luxurious it is not. It does however have a much more friendly feel than NAIA and Manila's domestic terminal.",2021-10-02,01:12:39,Roland Johansson,siya23@mallick.com,06703799286
The new terminal is clean and airy. It is still basic but fine enough for a small Asian airport. The security process was slow especially when they dealt with Caucasian-looking tourists. However the rest was amazing and there was a helpful tourist information which is quite visible within the security area. As expected most members of staff can only manage very simple English but they were quite helpful. The airport is a stone's throw away from town but walking is not quite possible due to government facilities with armed guards lining the way out from the airport. Taxis are cheap and most use the meter + 15000 dong for airport services.,2021-10-02,20:43:45,Ishaan Chadha,advik28@hotmail.com,0679-87 10 32
On returning from France on Easter Monday there was only one Long stay car park bus operating. It was overcrowded to the point of being illegal according to the allowed numbers printed inside the bus itself. It had to leave many people behind at the terminal and then drop off at all the long stay car parks making for a lengthy wait. On arrival at long stay 4 already delayed no cars were being allowed out of the exit without a telephone call to control and having to state your registration number a complete shambles. The bus and car park delay saw me exit the airport over an hour and 30 mins after the plane had landed and only with cabin baggage.

Security is a nightmare at Dublin. Despite arriving in good time for our flight we spent an hour waiting to go through security. Only four of the security stations were in use despite the airport being mobbed.

Cairo airport must be the most awkward airport in the world. I have flown through all 3 terminals so I know it quite well. There is no point in referring to the appalling terminal 2 as it is no longer in operation. The quality of staff and security processes are the biggest issues in my opinion. Regarding the staff there seems to be a scam between airport officials and taxi drivers to hand you over to the drivers that will rip you off. If you can prearrange transport you will be able to avoid that. There are 2 members of staff at passport control. The first will look at your passport and put the visa sticker on it and the second one will stamp it. And they both sit side by side. You have to security scan your suitcases before you check-in which causes absolute chaos. The stories are endless about this airport. On the up it is a clean airport modern and spacious with good duty free and good dinning options. And I have to say I have seen some improvements over the last 2 years which shows that Egyptians are making an effort to improve it.,2021-10-10,14:20:06,Misha Madan,fmuehle@aol.de,09681 05574

Very long queues for security tonight in zone B in Brussels. At least a 400m queue to reach the scanners it started just after the passport check desks and it was slow moving.

I travelled through Edinburgh on BA and Flybe flights. There was little in the way of queues at check-in but the main problem was at security. The queues were long and there was only one archway open for two scanners. The main downside of Edinburgh is the attitude of the security staff. They are officious and sometimes nasty. I believed that my first experience was a one- off but on the second occasion I formed the opinion that these people are not managed properly and should have lessons in how to treat the customer. It's a great shame as Edinburgh is actually a very good regional airport.,2021-09-13,09:13:53,Tom Conradi,uthkarsh43@hotmail.com,+49(0)9371 659887
First time visiting Doha and to be honest it is not very good. There is chaos probably as a result of over- staffing. The staff members walk around arbitrarily opening and closing lines resulting in large masses of people being moving around aimlessly. The bus transfers are long. Much easier to transit through European airports. Duty free on the first floor is pretty nice and there is a smaller duty free shop on the second floor.,2021-09-28,04:04:20,Dhanush Shan,bjorktobias@swipnet.se,7447689826
Cardiff Airport has strengths and weaknesses. It is small so you can easily get from one area to another without too much difficulty. It has a pleasant Executive Lounge and a small range of shops. Retrieval of baggage is fairly painless and staff are fairly friendly. However the airport is still set in the 1960's and the major re-construction work to make it a 2000's generation airport has not taken place. The limited choice of flights the supporting services of bars restaurants and car park all create the impression of an airport with limited ambition and initiative. Earlier comments about drop off and pick up remain issues to a certain extent (the logic of having a security barrier at which you are simply waved through without any check seems a particularly useless feature).,2021-09-14,02:36:16,Birgitta Olsson,jnystrom@lind.com,07516 676524

Not much in terms of Air activity. Probably the best attention I have ever got from airport staff maybe because not so many people go through. Staff were genuinely friendly and willing to offer help.

DOH-DXB: Arrived at a gate far away at terminal 1. Once in the hall the usual (regular traveller) chaos of Dubai ensued queues building up then lanes opened up with a mad dash of desperate travellers looking to beat the rush. Unfriendly immigration staff spending as much time talking to each other as actually serving travellers. The only sure way of beating the rush is to book the Marhaba meet and great service I'm suspicious they make immigration so bad that you are forced to use the Marhaba service!.

An airport that serves only 6 International Air carriers (I think) - it is breezily functional. Cool and modern the Australian airports tend to resemble each other - with little character to differentiate from each other. The Cairns Airport does look a little too big for its purpose. Check- in was fast and efficient though as there was minimal queue if any at all. Everything was done with little fuss and was much appreciated. Airport is only about 15-20 minutes away from the City Centre/Esplanade via Airport Shuttle Bus.,2021-09-14,18:07:49,Ingrid Magnusson,anitaholm@yahoo.de,06657580483
"I flew in 4 times to this airport within the last 2 weeks, 3 arrivals and 1 departure. Flew in to Terminal 1 where all the other airlines land at. Now this is a review for Terminal 1. This greatly varies to Terminal 3, where all the Emirates flight flies into (which is the posher terminal). Absolutely amazed at how bad the condition of the terminal is, considering this is a main hub for tourists and that this is Dubai. My flight from Muscat to Dubai was only 45-50 minutes long however the queue at the immigration? 1 hour 10 minutes - longer than my flight. The immigration was jam packed. Regardless the day or the time! I flew in on a Thursday afternoon (4pm): Packed. I flew in on a Monday morning (11am): Packed. I flew back in on Wednesday (12am): Packed. Oh and not to mention, it was boiling! I don't know if the staff noticed just how packed it was, but they certainly did not notice just how the amount of people equals to more body heat. Considering that is is Dubai, they can honestly do better. Because of all these queuing, I have decided to only fly to Abu Dhabi whenever I need to get to UAE again (unless I'm flying via Emirates).",2021-09-11,23:56:22,Prof. Zehra Huhn B.Sc.,shayakbir@yahoo.com,+914245120028
I was flying Jet Airways to Mumbai to catch my flight to Munich with Lufthansa. Two officers checking the same document 2 times before you even check in with the airline. Another luggage scan to be performed before you check in your baggage. After check in you go through security. Men and women have separate lines. This is where I encountered the most incredibly rude security staff. Even Mumbai Airport staff were better than here. Just the attitude of that person ruined the whole impression about the place. I suggest the airport authorities should give some customer service training to these staff before they are put to work.

A perfect introduction to all of the worst aspects of Bali. The new Bali airport is a shocker let's give credit where credit is due. It's clean has clean toilets and it's big and new that's it that's all that it currently has going for it. The worst things about the old Bali airport have moved across very comfortably to the new airport. Rude and arrogant immigration and customs officials. Deliberately lengthy immigration queues which always then have the option of paying extra to get through quickly. Ridiculously restrictive alcohol rules again so you can pay your way a round them. Endless hassling by porters. Then you end up in a beaten up taxi with a rude taxi driver charging you too much and taking too long. Basically an over priced rip off and a really ugly first impression of Indonesia and more sadly Bali.

I live in Kampala and fly in and out of this airport regularly. It is a rather small and quiet airport clean and modern after the refurbishment. There is not much to do a few duty free shops (overpriced) craft shops and a restaurant. Check-in area can be very crowded especially for BA KLM and Emirate flights. For all other international flights it is sufficient to arrive at the airport 1 hour before departure. The best this airport has to offer is probably the lounge.

Quite unbelievable. Flying in from Ho Chi Minh we thought 'this looks like a small airport'. Flying out was quite bizarre. The departure lounge is like a bus station waiting area - granny's curtains at the dirty windows and row after row of hard seats. One counter selling water and snacks. Another selling a few books. TV in the corner blaring away in Vietnamese. Smoking area is the corridor leading to the departure gate for Jetstar's flight to Hanoi. Unkempt and dirty they've obviously given up on the place. Ex-military and you really get the vibe it's for processing only. Thank goodness their new airport next door is almost finished.,2021-09-18,01:11:55,Aarush Ganguly,ulihesse@googlemail.com,04520219256
"SWhile the new Terminal 2 is spacious clean and well equipped check in-staff are not well trained. I came to the airport and they told me I should have had a hard copy ticket not an electronic ticket and there was nothing they could do about it. I insisted they try and resolve the problem. After waiting until all passengers were checked in I asked again for help. The girl begrudgingly said she'd go to the Main Office and took a French woman passenger with her with a similar problem but told me wait there. They were gone almost an hour and I asked for help from the remaining check in desk woman on duty. She told me she had nothing to do with ""my problem"" so my husband explained in Arabic and asked her politely for help. She was very rude and very angry I asked her for her name. She started screaming at me ""Are you the police? Are you a gendarme? I don't have to tell my name or badge number to anyone but the police."" She refused to call her supervisor and continued her contemptuous and rude treatment towards me yelling at me to go sit down. The police showed up and she calmed down. The other woman then arrived with the French woman she'd helped who also had only an electronic ticket but told me the same thing again ""We will put you on the plane to Lisbon and when you get there get your baggage and go find US Airways and ask them to straighten it out."" The police then escorted me to the plane which was late taking off which had inconvenienced all passengers. And all this problem because they claimed the computer systems don't communicate with Lisbon/US Airways.

Other than having to travel between the aircraft and the terminal by bus I have no problems with Doha but my review is based on travelling business class but I've never had any serious problems when flying economy. The new airport should be open soon so its goodbye to the free tour of the airport by bus.,2021-09-25,10:46:05,Kashvi Talwar,jbeier@steinberg.org,08-453 347 47
Recently transited on Emirates flights. The problem seems to be the construction workings which are overwhelming the coach transfer from aircraft to terminal. On arrival our coach took around 20 mins to the terminal and departure slightly less to the aircraft Its just not acceptable for a modern international hub and I thought T3 was a modern terminal! Communications are also a problem we sat in a dated poorly finished departure lounge for almost 3 hours 2 of which were after being told there would be a 15 minute delay in boarding and then we discovered the information given to us was untrue.,2021-09-27,20:31:53,Helen Björklund,lkarlsson@malm.net,+49(0)1917 54363
I have used Copenhagen Airport hundreds of times and this airport has never disappointed. The design of Terminal 3 bright light spacious modern and yet cosy. The walk to/from gates can be a little long though.

It did not matter to me how big or new Indira Ghandi Airport was to me I was not impressed at all. The airport was a major disappointment to anyone using it. The attitude of the workers at the airport is horrible. Check-in workers will just throw your bags on to the belt in front of you. Immigration lines are ridiculous. Locals and foreigners are queuing up together. Locals were mostly cutting through the line and making the line so confusing and packed up that it did not look like a line. No one was there to control the line and immigration workers refused to do anything about it. There was just no system to it. I was glad to leave the airport.,2021-09-20,15:16:20,Jivika Gulati,vstumpf@haase.com,034-471 62 49
Just used Doha airport to and from Cebu. Airport is very clean plenty of comfortable seating and toilets. Did not use any of the eating facilities as stay was not long. Only criticism is the chaos getting through the transfer x-rays 2000+ people desperate to get through for flights which had announced last calls more staff stopping queue jumping would have helped.,2021-10-05,20:11:39,Isabel Gude,irmelaraedel@hecker.net,009-119 69 50

Airport of Cebu is very laid back style. But it makes me feel more convenient than to go Manila airport. There are 4 international airlines to choose from - Cathay Silk Air Malaysia Airlines and Qatar airways. Its hassle free airport and when it comes to transportation lots of taxi outside the airport.

Checked in for my Qantas flight with Quickcheck which was very efficient. Then a short trip to the bag drop counter and we were on our way up the escalators to the gate lounge. Hardly anyone around and we were surprised that there weren't any kiosks or cafes to grab something at. However there was plenty of seating. I'm told that the Virgin area has a bit more activity as well as a cafe or two. You'd hope this little airport doesn't become a MEL or a SYD anytime soon.,2021-10-08,14:54:29,Dipl.-Ing.

The previous comments are all spot on - but on rare days it can work like a dream. Returned from Aghios Gordios Friday Aug 10th at 11 pm for a 01:00am flight to East Midlands. Disembarked the minibus at 23:45 check in desk open luggage straight into scanners and through passport control by midnight and on the plane around 00:30 ready for take-off. Meanwhile passengers for other destinations were queuing as described though I spotted that new sheltered seating had been provided outside since I was last there. I dread to think what it could have been like had the visitor numbers not been so visibly down since my last visit. The local taverna owners all commented on it. I've come to expect to be patient waiting for luggage on the way into Corfu but much worse are the queues for departures when you're tired and a bit fed up at the thought of going home at all! The worst part of the trip was the flight home on the most uncomfortable plane I've ever been in. Corfu Airport is a lovely little airport and I have to agree it surely would work so much better if the holiday companies managed their collection of travellers from resorts with more regard for the airport's handling facilities and staggered their arrivals and departures better through the week.,2021-09-21,03:57:36,Karl Nordström,hbhatti@yahoo.com,+49(0)4940 31569
I have flown internationally many many times but only through San Francisco. This week my wife and I had to go through Chicago's O'Hare and it was horrible! For some reason the people that run the immigration and customs have decided to automate the process yet they still had bungling fools directing people and checking documents. The people checking documents who we assumed were immigration officers had no clue. The immigration people took our customs paperwork which are usually taken by the customs officers after you get your baggage. Several immigration officers had piles of them on their check-in desks. At immigration they make you go to a computer that scans your passport then takes your photo. If you are travelling with someone it takes theirs along with yours. We then get a major surprise: one officer is checking everyone's baggage all 300 of us from the flight from Germany! The line is very long and very slow. I can only imagine some older couple getting extremely stressed out by this process.,2021-09-11,15:43:51,Shanaya Kar,soodbadal@kamdar-shankar.com,+46 (0)8 865 525 77
Pretty poor airport but it does the important things ok. Food and drink wise there is a cafe/bar landside and some sort of Taverna outside but all you have airside is a smallish outlet serving sandwiches/pies and drinks (if you're lucky) and unbelievably doesn't accept cards of any type. Worse than that there is no allocated seating beyond a few small stands. Just to round things off the staff were rude and miserable. There is no cash machine airside nor is there a drinking fountain should you get thirsty and have no Euros. On top of that you are packed in with far too many people for the seating available. There are a couple of duty free shops. Thankfully there is air conditioning or it would be pretty unbearable. If you are a smoker then get your fix before you go through security if you have a long wait for your flight as there is no smoking anywhere. Note take no notice of your holiday rep telling you to queue outside. It'll be boiling hot and there is nothing to stop you waiting in the air conditioned terminal or going to the cafe upstairs. A pretty poor show for such a busy (at least in season) airport. Corfu is not some small little island that only sees a flight a day and it should have an airport that is appropriate to modern needs. Having said that Greece is really going through it at the moment so nothing much is going to change anytime soon. It won't bother me though I'm not going back to Corfu again. It's a tatty old place these days and there are far better places to spend your holidays.,2021-09-23,06:19:06,Marcus Ladeck,buchholzcosimo@aol.de,+912667333827
The biggest queue at Edinburgh Airport should be the one for the job centre as whoever made the decision on the new security hall needs to be fired almost 6 months later and there are still unacceptable details. You can of course pay for Fasttrak which really is false advertising. Come on team get it sorted or move over so someone can.

CHA is a compact but efficient airport serving a metropolitan market of about 500000 residents. In the past it has suffered from proximity to major airports in Nashville and Atlanta but today 7 airlines service Chattanooga with a rather rapidly growing number of destinations. The airport is very clean with free Wi-Fi throughout and parking and security is superior. Low fare airlines have joined the legacy carriers so there is quite a nice selection of flights and fares. Sure saves time and headaches of leaving from larger airports.,2021-09-23,09:26:10,Elisabet Johansson,cathleen32@bolzmann.com,0906700533
Transited through Chicago en route to Delhia from Philadelphia. I had 8 hours between flights enroute to Delhi so popped into town by train for a walk. It was easy cheap and convenient to take the train downtown. On my way home had a 2 hour transit between flights from Delhi and onward to Philly. No problem. Passport contol customs and rechecking my bag went smoothly. Transit between T5 and T3 was easy on the Airport Transit System. Security was a bit slow but nothing unexpected. I was through everything an at my gate with an hour spare.,2021-10-07,12:34:21,Nitara Choudhury,okaran@gmail.com,5232163290
"For an airport which is less than 5 years old and which was (presumably) purpose-built for its home carrier Egyptair CAI is a horrific experience. The terminal is built in a V-shape  with F and G gates extending along the arms of the 'V'. H gates are for flights accessible by bus and the gates are downstairs at the base of the V. There is no real holding area where passengers can wait for their flights except two largeish restaurants. As a result the arms of the terminal (i.e. the F and G gates) are severely crammed with passengers awaiting flights. The layout of each arm means that access between the restaurants and the F/G gates re often blocked by passengers queuing for flights and every available seat was taken. I visit the airport twice in September. On the first occasion I was changing from Egyptair to Ethiopian (both international flights) and had to hand in my passport for it to be checked by immigration. Surely this contravenes the laws of international transit? I then had to go back downstairs to international arrivals to pick up my passport and get a re-issued boarding card one hour before departure of my ET flight. On the second trip I was changing between MS flights so I thought ""great no problem"". However my onward boarding card was handwritten and was forced to join the long international transit passenger queue by some unpleasant jobsworth. There were around 10 people behind the counter but only one was actually doing any work. It was only when a second official asked if anybody had an onward boarding card that I managed to queue-jump and get a re-issued printed boarding card quickly. Internet access is available outside one of the several lounges for Star Alliance Business/First class passengers. Finally there is a smoking room opposite gate F2 but this was simply disgusting: dirty too small and with just three chairs. If an airport is going to offer smoking facilities to its guests it should either do it properly or not at all.",2021-10-09,20:59:31,Gitta Hande,hayredevansh@yahoo.com,(04771) 98732
"Having travelled the world this is one of the worst airports I've had the unfortunate pleasure to experience. Third world countries have more organized and passenger friendly airports than FLL. Not one employee seems to be engaged in their job and there is terrible to no choice to find something to eat.

Perhaps some travelers are satisfied by a new airport building. I am happy if I must not stay at any airport for longer than necessary. Cairo is a very bad example for ignoring customers. My flight from Nairobi with Egyptair was delayed almost 90 minutes! There was no explanation and wrong information from airline staff. It would have been no problem to get the connection flights. But Cairo seems to want to avoid delays in their statistics. So they sent the connection flights.,2021-09-10,03:19:08,Dhanush Ramesh,marisakrause@googlemail.com,087-48 15 86

In general it is a normal airport. There are some shops places to sit etc. bathrooms are relatively clean. However I faced huge issues when I had to use the parking facilities. There is no gratis period for a car to come in and just pick you up for a very short period. This is very inappropriate because afterwards the only way to pay is in the local currency. EUR is not accepted anywhere and the exchange rates are very unfavorable. Moreover they did not accept to exchange small money (in my case 10 EUR). This caused a huge inconvenience for me and I have to say that the staff was not friendly either. I am definitely not keen on coming to this airport again!,2021-10-06,21:59:04,Katarina Holmqvist,dpreiss@lorch.com,073-692 85 65
Arriving at Dalaman: Is perfectly fine. Baggage is always pretty much waiting for you the longest we have waited is 10 minutes. The VISA queues can be slow but that is mainly because people don't have the correct money ready. Departing from Dalaman: Absolute joke of a place. We love Turkey and have been 6 times but the one thing I always dread is going home. Rude security. Useless check in staff that can't add up 13 kg + 15 kg does not equal 48 kg!

After getting off a 14-hour flight myself and the boyfriend got stuck in the passport control queue for an hour and a half. We noticed that half the desks were unmanned and the attendants that were working took their time having 5-minute conversations with each passenger. The service was terrible - our attendant decided he didn't like a couple of guys in the queue and kept them waiting while he let others behind them through with no explanation. It took so long for us to get through that when we finally got to the baggage carousel it had stopped and our bags had been taken off. It was an exhausting experience after a long flight the least they could do is staff their desks.,2021-10-03,08:45:28,Myra Maharaj,sekhonmadhup@yahoo.com,00136918875
Having been a frequent visitor to the island over the past ten years I can confirm that the airport has gone from unorganised chaos to organised chaos! It is fair to say that the staff and management at the airport have done a lot to get their act together but still seem to do things the greek way and to greek time. The new system of checking into receive boarding passes and then taking your cases to the end of the check in desk for scanning does seem to be speeding up the queues but i still have to ask why they have to make this a separate procedure? On my visit in July the new check in system worked so well that the queue for passport control was now snaking twice round all the way back out of the terminal and back in and up to the one security guard checking passports. Two Guards would have made this easier and faster but then how would the hand baggage scanners keep up? The Airport have to build in delays somewhere along the chain and make passengers queue somewhere along the line otherwise they just would not cope with the demand and the whole process would just collapse! The Airport does not help matters when it herds all non domestic passengers through one end of the terminal leaving the other end of the terminal that is used for internal flights empty. They could also scan luggage once it has been checked in. As for the tour operators? I know most seem to work to a Monday/Friday system but i think some also go on Tuesdays. We have to share the airport with other tour operators from other countries like Germany and the airport has allocated other days of the week to them otherwise it would never cope. I think the thing that frustrates us all is why three or four planes from the UK arrive within the hour and snarl up the arrivals system? The baggage reclaim hall is tiny with only two carousels. Everyone is also too impatient when arriving into the hall to reclaim their baggage! When you arrive in the hall just relax and take your time! Use the toilet find a trolley or make contact with your holiday rep in arrivals or collect your hire car. Corfu is not like our airports and you can wander freely into the arrivals hall at any time to sort out what you need to. It always amuses to see a plane load of passengers jostling for position at the carousel and then waiting half an hour for the belt to spring into life. The Greeks do not rush and they certainly don't worry about a hall full of impatient passengers!,2021-10-08,17:24:29,Natascha Bauer,hertrampfalexandros@putz.com,+46 (0)8 216 955 98
Arrived from Dulles. Has three terminals (A B C) and they are connected by a train which is very quick. You could probably get from A to C in 5 minutes on this train although I don't know how often they arrive. TSA security line was very long and slow moving although you can sign up to an express security scheme there for an annual fee so this may be worthwhile for people who frequently go through DEN. After arriving you need to take the train to baggage claim which can be a tedious journey to go to the other side of the airport just to collect your bags. Sign posting for this is not immediately apparent to someone new to the airport. Ground transportation to downtown is plentiful but taxis are expensive ($65). Best to get the $20 airport shuttle bus which your hotel can arrange and which you can pay in cash. ATMs everywhere but they appear not to take Maestro cards so be warned. Distance from downtown is quite far and a car or taxi takes just under 40 minutes early in the morning and possibly longer later in day with traffic. Huge selection of excellent cafes restaurants and souvenir stores. Also has small number of internet PC stations so you wont need a wi-fi enabled laptop to get online here.

Every time I am at the airport I see at least half the passengers disembark on the wrong section (transit) and I find them coming back. This takes too much time just because the busses we travel do not have voice over instructions. This could save ground staff so much hassle.

Domestic terminal undergoing major renovations/additions. Long walk from gate through building site and then quite a way outside to taxi upon arrival. All ok if you are up to it but could be difficult for less mobile or with lots of baggage/children. Also ok if not pouring with rain. On departure taxi drops off and you have to cross a road without cover to get into terminal all ok if weather ok but you could get soaked if raining hard as is normal at this time of year. Was selected for hand baggage and clothing swab for explosives. Security staff nice and friendly.,2021-09-24,14:13:13,Nitara Bail,nkumar@ratta.net,+49(0)8021308754
As others have pointed out this airport has turned into a shopping mall with some airline gates. Everything is annoyingly designed to make you go in the shops from herding you from the security check through a giant tax- free shop almost without signage to the total lack of seating in the terminal itself. Airside areas are filthy shabby unwelcoming and with low ceilings. They have a lot of baggage belts at arrivals but usually just use a few of them with bags from several flights arriving on one belt resulting in chaos. Together with often long waiting times that is maybe also a method to make you go to the arrival shop. Also be prepared to walk to and from the gates. There are only a few moving walkways and they are - yes you guessed it only available in areas without shops.,2021-10-04,07:25:11,Mikael Larsson,lorenzetzold@aol.de,(07905) 051794
Went through Dublin twice on way to US and back on July 21 / Aug 16 2014. Massive queues at US pre-clearance on way out which were understandable if rather frustrating. Less understandable on return when trying to catch connecting flight to UK around 5am queued at Dublin for around 1hr 15min to get through passport and screening even though had done same on leaving Boston and had been in presumably secure environment since then. Hundreds in queue again connecting flights having to be held travellers beginning to panic as gate closure times being passed.

I have arrived and departed via Terminal 2 (domestic flights) several times and it has been a decent experience. In fact CUN was making some progress previous to the Hurricane Wilma incident. The location of the airport is quite far away from Cancun but its in the center of the Maya Riviera complex. True many improvements can be made (especially when it comes to entertainment and ventilation) but it fares quite well compared to other Mexican airports. Transportation wise there are some problems but it fares better than Honolulu or San Diego.,2021-10-04,17:24:03,Gloria Wende-Stey,ullaaxelsson@lindholm.org,07852251813
FLR is a very small airport- I believe the smallest I have ever been to. The LH check in was nice and relatively helpful especially as I had changed my ticket although they refused to check me in for my flight to O'hare. The bar was reasonably priced but a pain to use. The departures lounge was tiny with 5 gates for Schengen flights and one for International flights. They made us take a bus to the plane despite the fact that you could see it from the airport - it would have been quicker and better exercise to just walk to the plane.

Cool modern design and lots of space to sit. I arrived in BRU too early and thus had a long wait for my flight and found you have to pay for the wireless internet. No entertainment thus. The free charging stations for your laptop/cell phone were useful though. Toilets clean (despite someone had been smoking in there). What I really found annoying was the journey to the luggage claim up and down escalators and long corridors. I also didn't realize the exit was in the middle of the luggage claim area and not in the end and thus wandered around looking a bit lost. There was also no mailbox after the security check - I forgot to mail my postcards before going in. The maps claimed there should've been one but I really couldn't find it.

I fly through DIA every few month and find the airport to be one the best in the country. No matter which airline you fly on the check-in is always fast and efficient. Security can be a bit of a pain as it takes a long time but everything else is ok. The automated train reaches the concourses quickly and all concourses have a nice selection of restaurants and book stores. Even the immigration process goes by quickly. Upon arrival from Frankfurt I was greeted by a friendly customs agent and retrived my baggage with in an hour of my arrival. The only problem with the airport is the long taxi times and the bumpy departures and arrivals.

New terminal just opened and looks very european - spacious good layout and good sign posting. New terminal only being used for arrivals at the minute and so departures was through the old terminal which was unfortunate. On departure the duty free shop sells books and magazines but no newspapers a sign says that newspapers are available for sale before you go through security but to get to the duty free shop in the first place you have to pass through security with no one allowed back out - I hope someone works that one out before the new terminal opens for departures.,2021-10-07,22:53:17,Valerij Hahn-Schüler,hans-gerdcichorius@kostolzin.com,4943787909
Flew from new Guangzhou Bayon to Ho Chi Minh City. Be prepared for delays going through security screening. With the new airport it appears they have hired a lot of new security screeners. While professional and unfailingly polite they lack experience. As such they do not recognize as safe such many harmless metal items as nail clippers tweezers (or in my casea cheap sewing kit scissors with a one-inch blade). As a result be prepared for delays - perhaps lengthy - while they spend a lot of time searching your bag (or that of the person ahead of you!) and examining these items which they then decide are harmless.,2021-09-24,01:13:10,Anders Andersson,ulla-brittnilsson@bergman.org,02986 302997

"Pleasant modern airport not too big and not too small.

But why can't the toilets have soap? And be less smelly? Why can't the ""FreeAirportWifi"" work? Why do the scamming porters who clamour to push your luggage 30 meters whether you protest or not and then ask for money apparently do so with the airport's blessing and wearing an official looking uniform?

What more can you say about DXB that hasn't already been said? It's bursting at the seems and the DFS are laid out in such a way that it sees everyone assembled in the only main corridor that runs the length of the terminal! I got bogged down just trying to navigate my trolley around the place. The immigration and security lines took nearly 1hr with so many empty counters and only 5 staff doing passport checks. Dubai is busiest in the early morning and the evening so you'd think it'd be geared with more staff but that isn't the case. Whenever I fly via DXB I always enter with a sense of dread and accomplishment when I get out of there in one piece. Then new facility for the A380 is fantastic but also crowded though I didn't experience it so much as I was using the lounge but sure enough the lounges were bursting at the seems too. Dubai Airport needs to stop building long narrow tubes and start building wide malls like the massive shopping malls in the city.,2021-09-11,17:09:33,Louise Göransson,akarshvenkataraman@mane.com,5837212228
Going through Customs in Charlotte was horrible. Long lines. Very few employees. One employee in particular was rude and obnoxious. I have been through Customs many other places including London a week ago...all were a breeze to get through. Charlotte also used to be easy. What has happened?,2021-09-28,10:03:30,Dipl.-Ing.

This airport is a joke for all the tall claims Qatar Airways or their ads make. The Airport is a disaster starting with the longest bus ride from the plane to the Terminal (at time waiting at the door of the plane as the Bus has not yet found its way to us). Once you get to the terminal things get worse. There are two or three outlets where you can buy food. The selection is rubbish service is shabby. The prices are over the top. The available lounges are small and most of the time they refuse to honour the complimentary access assured by our Credit Cards (Platinum and above). I would hate to be stranded there more than an hour or so.,2021-09-26,00:22:06,Anna Gunnarsson,inyman@spray.se,0227699097
Small but fantastic airport very modern and clean. Terminal is easy to get around Internet is quick and many shops and dining areas present at the airport. All in all a great new airport and one of the finest in Australasia.,2021-10-09,08:21:49,Suhana Varty,susanneengstrom@andersson.se,1863785315
CLT is a very nice airport with an easy-to-understand approach. It is also the airport of choice if you are supposed to be heading to any location in South Carolina like CAE (Columbia) or GSP (Greenville- Spartanburg). Taking that next leg is quite expensive so land at CLT and rent a vehicle. The parking garage is simple and very close to the main building. I'd recommend CLT as a good portcall for anyone entering the USA as their customs are efficient.,2021-09-25,13:32:30,Ivana Sama,ulrika22@gmail.com,08-622 950 38
Very disappointed that since the take over of Cardiff airport no budget airline has returned eg. BMI Baby or would be nice to see Ryanair or EasyJet. Living in Wales we should be able to get flights for the same price as available from Bristol airport and not get the extra flight supplements also more competitive airlines than Thomson or Thomas Cook. I and many friends and family choose to travel to Bristol driving past Cardiff airport as there is usually a saving of at least £600 per family booking when travelling from Bristol with these airlines. Cardiff really needs to look at the services and flights available if it is going to develop in a competitive market.,2021-09-13,22:22:10,Martine Mude-Klemm,niclas39@nilsson.se,(06484) 382691
Just arrived back from Turkey via Dalaman Airport - holiday but was ruined by my experience at this airport. Security screening and check in was fine but when they opened the gate for boarding it was absolute chaos. They didn't call for passengers disabled or with children to come forward first. Nor did they call people in certain rows. There were two flights for the same gate 34 and people were confused about which queue to be in as no direction was given. Then they couldn't get buses to take passengers to the plane last call was flashing on the screen and 100's of passengers were still waiting to be transported to the plane. It must have been a frightening experience for elderly and disabled people. I don't think I could face this airport again. Thankfully we did not purchase any food here as we had been warned in advance about the outrageous prices.,2021-09-27,04:29:11,Henrik Andersson,jonssondagmar@yahoo.de,+49(0)6916 394515
Despite airbridges had to walk across a cold rain drenched apron likewise on departure. Then up two flights of stairs to get to passport control. A woman just bypassed the queue at this stage and walked out through an unmanned desk. Remarkable. Luggage took a while to arrive on the carousel our aircraft was the only one on the apron. Departure was more buisness like.,2021-10-07,08:35:49,Johannes Johnsson,nkrein@junitz.com,+49 (0) 0959 581289
We recently went from Lubbock to Miami via Dallas/Ft. Worth on American Airlines. Dallas is one of the best airports I've been to. The American Airlines Terminal A is very new very modern has lots of food and retail options and is very uncrowded. The half-circle layout of the terminal was excellent because it doesn't take forever to get from one gate to another. The Skylink stops are very convenient and there are 2-3 in each terminal it's a good way to get from one terminal to the other without taking a bus. Our flight to Miami was out of Terminal C another very modern very clean terminal. Overall a nice airport serving the Dallas area.,2021-10-07,12:23:36,Anna Johansson,kanav70@ben.com,+49 (0) 7942 531446
Terminal A for Schengen flights is quite comfortable with much natural daylight and plenty of seating areas. But it is quite a long walk to the baggage claim area using numerous escalators. Catering is good and reasonably priced. Trains to downtown Brussels run every 20min and are cheap. Please note that the ticket vending machines accept Euro coins only and no credit cards. Signals in the check-in halls could be improved as it is rather difficult to locate the right counter.,2021-09-19,16:17:09,Per Strand,lillemor14@pettersson.se,4386524405
"As a first time user of this airport I was extremely disappointed. Going through security was as you expect busy, however when I went through I had very rude staff who work in the duty free shop push in front of me, and were incredibly rude about it. As I walked through the scanner, I went to get my items, to which the rude employee was stood waiting for her bag. I literally just picked up my coat and she decided to be condescending and rude telling me to move my stuff. I said I'm just picking up my coat. To which she replied abruptly no one else can get their stuff - bearing in mind there was a massive queue of trays before mine, but as she pushed in those people were still filtering through. Not happy. First time users do not know how every single airport works as this one seems very different. Maybe they should come up with a better idea for staff instead of them going through with customers as they seem to not be able to get to work in enough time to allow for the checks.",2021-09-27,17:49:04,Ojas Balasubramanian,lioba63@warmer.de,3081606617
"Arrived at 5.40 am for a 6.45 flight. Had checked in online and had only hand baggage. Went directly to security where we were forced to wait outside closed doors for five minutes. Edinburgh is transitioning to a new security hall. The passengers who have already been through security in the new hall have to cross at right angles the passengers who have yet to go through security in the old hall. Their solution is to close the doors to the old hall let the ""new hall"" passengers cross then close the doors to the new hall and let passengers pile into the old hall. We were told not to go to the new hall but wait there for the old hall. So we waited. On entry we found an enormous queue of passengers and only two security lanes (plus fast track) in operation. This was rush hour at Edinburgh airport. There was no calling of passengers forward for flights that were already boarding it was a case of hurry-up-and-wait (and no information). The passengers were shirty the security staff were harassed and rude. Bottom line - despite being an hour early for my flight and only needing to get through security I missed my plane. I wasn't the only one - three of us converged on the boarding gate at the same time. The only alternative flight was towards the end of the afternoon so my trip was cancelled. Edinburgh security used to be a dream (10-15 mins even during rush hour). Now it's a nightmare. There's no information on the website to let you know to be very early for your flight. Fast-track might just be worth it although another reviewer's comment about the lack of fast track in the new hall suggests maybe not.",2021-09-10,10:02:31,Ing.

I have travelled extensively around the world and would have to say that Cairns Domestic Airport is nothing short of disgraceful. Check in is OK but from there on it's an absolute shambles. Several flights have passengers in the one queue and you don't have any idea if you are in the correct one. The Airlines P/A is inaudible and there is very little seating in the common boarding area. Once you have worked out that you are in the correct very long queue it's a long wait to get through to the boarding check in and then it's almost a marathon walk to the aircraft. It must be at least 800+ metres and after walking up and down concrete ramps you then end up on an airbridge. There is no doubt that this appalling airport will put me off visiting Cairns again.,2021-09-14,17:13:57,Åke Andersson,hakan78@swipnet.se,0682-667 41
Bit unfair to review in some ways as this airport is currently being re-vamped. The domestic side is in dire need of work. Small pokey and tired it will be hopefully much improved soon. The International departures area has been done and is quite good though there are not enough seats when it is busy and it is lacking in character. What a shame this pretty city did not get an airport that reflects some of it's charm?,2021-10-04,00:38:13,Elisabeth Carlsson,giselawilms@wagenknecht.de,+49(0)4383 976402
A surprisingly good airport in terms of efficiency. While check-in is becoming a bit more chaotic and takes longer due to increased traffic it still has one of the quickest check-in times for an airport in Europe. Arrivals are usually a breeze. I think the longest I've had to wait at passport control is 5 minutes and the longest for baggage 15 minutes. The building and services are in need of an upgrade but that's OK with me since it's easy to spend a minimum amount of time at the airport.,2021-10-05,12:26:00,Siya Agarwal,pnystrom@telia.com,08027 824553
My only experience of transiting DOH in the past was as a J class passenger and having read the reviews of the airport for transiting 'down the back' I did wonder if I had done the right thing. The flight was an hour early and there transit terminal security check was deserted so there were no bad experiences and I was soon walking around the duty free shops. Cost of food in the food outlets seemed OTT but there is nothing new in that concept! Boarding for the onward connection was orderly although making everyone use the rear steps for boarding was a pain especially as the other steps wouldn't have disturbed the J class passengers (who in fact hadn't boarded anyway). I sincerely hope that the new airport will do away with the need for bussing (which is pretty much a thing of the past at most airports). Otherwise not half as bad as I feared!,2021-09-14,12:58:45,Myra Seth,sara96@googlemail.com,+911625342403
Relatively small but efficient and clean. General facilities are good good duty free shopping. Some gates are much nicer that others especially toilets. Can be crowded at peak hours but not really a problem to move around or get in or out of it. The government has announced a new larger international airport will be built 60 km. South leaving La Aurora only for local flights and non commercial civil aviation. Eventually both airports are to be connected by a fast rail service.,2021-09-15,12:11:03,Margaretha Johansson,madeleine62@swipnet.se,+49(0)7300 74126

"Facilities in Departure Lounges - both domestic and international - excellent but the system of making transit pax sit in the ""visitors lounge"" until the security guard chooses to allow you through to check-in might mean you don't have a lot of time to appreciate them.

Such a shame that Edinburgh is let down so badly by its baggage system. It is truly appaling - I arrive back into Edinburgh from various destinations once or twice a week and always wait for an eternity for my bag - just arrived home having arrived on a 45 min flight only to wait a further 40 for my bag.

"Dammam airport is huge with about 65 gates but in reality it doesn't need to be. Arrival was painless. Immigration looks as if it will take forever at first but as soon as immigration staff realise it's going to be busy they open more desks and the queue soon clears. Customs scan every bag from every person as you leave. When returning you must have your checked luggage scanned before check in otherwise you cannot check the bag. Queues for check in weren't too bad but then I was 3 hours early for the KLM flight. Be prepared before going through security as although the queue looks long it moves fast and security staff get annoyed if they have to ask you to remove your belt watch etc but they are very pleasant if you are ready. The flight I was waiting for was leaving at 1:15am and there were a few international flights but the cafe was closed. The only place to buy refreshments was from a ""trolley"" however the coffee wasn't bad and wasn't too expensive but nothing to eat that was hot. There is one duty free shop with various items for sale (including washing powder?) and prices are okay. I walked from one end of the airport to the other which took 10 minutes at normal pace and only 6 gates had passengers waiting by them. Interestingly there used to be a few Business Class lounges but these appear to have been closed and moved to one lounge such is the under use of this airport. I would be happy to fly though this airport again mainly because even though there is nothing really to do it is easy to find somewhere quiet to relax and plenty of seats and the staff are mostly very friendly.",2021-09-17,10:47:04,Aaryahi Sethi,pramanathan@gmail.com,7799828909
It is normal to wait 2-3 hours at immigration which is very tiresome when you have already travelled for many hours. There is a total lack of security officers and obviously little or no organization. The management says it is a question of security but in reality it is impossible to hide how badly organized O'Hare immigrations is.,2021-09-11,16:26:25,Faiyaz Wable,vbolzmann@stumpf.de,08-637 64 75
45 minutes to wait for luggage when only one international flight had landed is simply unacceptable or to quote the word which was one of the options on the SMS questionnaire that passengers can complete pathetic. Also the luggage was delivered to a different carousel to the one shown on the boards. The aircraft I arrived on (EK) was parked away from the terminal and we were bussed to the terminal. The driver did not bother to park close to the steps and passengers had to walk through puddles of rainwater. The airport has good facilities is extremely clean and immigration was reasonably fast. Large areas are still under construction and I prefer not to think what might happen with the 2010 football matches. It is clear though that they are making an effort and are responsive to feedback as I received a call from a lady at the airport not long after sending off the SMS questionnaire..,2021-09-25,04:50:45,Vedika Sarin,lakshaybarad@hotmail.com,(09332) 65664
Airport fails to measure up. It is a great facility but when you get to the details it falls way short. Parking is a disaster and very expensive.

Arrived from LHR at 0830 after 13hr flight non stop with BA. Immigration queue was OK took about 20 mins which meant our luggage was waiting on the carousel. Then it all went haywire. Air France Iberia Lufthansa and Alitalia flights all arrived within an hour of ours so imagine about 1000 people plus suitcases trying to get through customs. 6 lines all formed in a very haphazard way which then moulded into 4 lines for 4 x-ray machines. This took us an hour to get through and into arrival hall. Another 90 mins standing there while our holiday reps organised coach transport. International Terminal A and the surrounding roads can't cope at peak times for all these arrivals. Our departure was much smoother I'm pleased to say. Luggage drop off fine security queue took about 10 mins passport control about the same. Stayed in the LAN lounge which is close to our departure gate (10). The departure lounge is modern I hope they do something about the Arrivals hall which leaves a lot to be desired.,2021-09-12,23:48:49,Miraya Gopal,gutegerti@huebel.de,093-48 76 37
This airport is not as bad as people are saying. The only negative thing I can comment on is the long walk from terminal to terminal. However after 6 hours flight it was a pleasure to be able to stretch our legs and walk around a bit before our next flight. The check-out counter wasn't as bad bearing in mind we had our kids between us. Even my little on wanted to use the toilet as soon as we got to the immigration counter. It wasn't our turn but the staff asked the rest of the family to stay while I took my daughter to the toilets and back. We did have to collect our bags (route was to Orlando) and recheck them so they could be taken to Orlando. As soon as we left immigration there were airport staff waiting for us asking for bags to Orlando. The other negative is that you always have to check the boards to check which terminal you will be connecting. The announcement on our plane from London gave a different terminal when we were coming out but on getting inside airport the boards gave a completely different one. However I think it is a good airport. Yes the security checks is madness but this is the world we live in. I would rather go through this sort of security checks than be killed by some terrorist. In my opinion it is not a bad airport for its size. The airport is clean the toilet facilities were excellent the cafes restaurants and shops were good maybe a bit expensive but this is what you get at most airports.,2021-09-26,04:46:33,Bhamini Saha,hannah23@kreusel.net,+46 (0)8 981 018 62
I have just read the previous reviews and I'm sorry but I totally disagree with them! Quick check in quick through security yes they are strict but welcome to a modern safety conscious airport. Compared with some of the modern airports it could do with modernising however that really does not bother me. Parking was cheap at the Holiday Inn Express with a free taxi to the front door which took 2 minutes altogether. Cardiff airport has retained another passenger and would recommend to anyone else.,2021-10-01,00:18:49,Kerstin Andersson,elisabeth25@swipnet.se,00059465214
Pleasantly surprised - both incoming and outgoing - no real hassles crowds or delays - just follow the signs. Arrival to pick up approx 30mins drop off to duty free shopping approx 25 mins.

Clearly not designed for the numbers of people it handles. However I was there in low season and I think staff at least make a good attempt at moving people through efficiently. The biggest problem is the huge distance from the terminal to drop-off points with touts all along the way. Also the prices in the airport are the same as western airports (despite Bali being otherwise very cheap).,2021-09-17,17:15:56,Vivaan Rana,indranilkannan@lall.com,08-97 89 72
With the new automated Boarding Pass terminals the check-in is pretty speedy which makes the check-in efficient. Restaurant & bar upstairs are reasonable and deliver good quality food & drink (helpful staff!). Friendly ground-personnel and no need to run a marathon to reach the gate makes it a relaxing experience. Once you go though the security and passport check you seem to arrive in quite a different country all-together: 'tax-free' is a complete rip-off prices of salmon are triple(!) of that in Cork (same trademark and quantity) so duly you bleed for your families request. A cup of coffee at the bar suffers the same added-value while seemingly being made out a mixture of tarmac and dishwater here the personnel seems to be trained not to understand any language (I tried 3) and so ignoring my protest (he was probably rightfully to ashamed to respond). The permanent wind over the tarmac - Cork airport is on the top of a hill - blows you right in the direction of your plane. Arriving back is a breeze after a good lunch upstairs (I don't like the grub in planes) missing the bus I queried a cab-driver: € 42 for airport to Cobh so I informed him it was € 30 the other way around with a Cobh taxi firm his response: 'Ah ye see that's why we don't allow them for pickup any fares from here' welcome home.,2021-10-06,16:17:20,Waltrud Bolzmann-Pölitz,hueseyin48@gmx.de,+49(0)8103608037

I have flown into Maracaibo via CCS twice this year (both Air France) and after both experiences I have to remind myself to fly via Aruba next time even with the extra 200 EUR of flying KLM (AMS- Aruba). The reasons - All European flights arrive around the same time so you can imagine the line at the immigration counters. Of 10 desks on both times there were only 3 open. First time we queued for 1.5 hours (and the suitcases were waiting outside next to the belt). The second time we risked missing our connecting flight so an officer kindly let us skip the +2 hrs queue at the time we got on the line. The international and domestic terminals are not connected so when transferring it takes a 10 min walk (and carrying your suitcases) under a devil sun. You are not allowed to take the trolleys out of the terminals so the option you have (unless you carry it yourself) is to pay for a porter. I don't know how much it is since we decided to carry them ourselves. Be sure to cool off later on as the AC is barely noticeable inside the terminals. Domestic terminal same chaos as international. Upon departure make sure to check in as soon as it is open - same immigration queues! We were almost the first ones checking in and it still took us more than 30 mins to get through immigration! I must say however it is being remodelled and the new international departure area (before entering secure zone) has a nice food court incl Subway and TGI Fridays. Among others I have flown into Nigeria via Lagos and I must say Caracas is the worst airport I have ever encountered and will avoid it whenever possible. Departure tax is also more expensive than when flying out directly from Maracaibo (nice small international airport).,2021-09-14,23:26:03,Martin Karlsson,myriammangold@hornich.de,024-542 10 17
Florence airport has recently moved the ground floor check-in desks to the first floor which is completely revamped. Some good leather seating is provided in nice airy surroundings. However the 3 check-in monitors are very small and concentrated along one small area thus meaning passengers must walk up to view them. The disadvantage of these monitors (at the time we were there) is they only show the major airlines desk numbers several scheduled flights remained without desk numbers including our Vueling flight. It was only when we asked an employee that we discovered the desks for our flight. Even after we had checked in no desk numbers were shown on the screens. Security was quick and trouble-free. Prices in the duty free area were just outrageous higher than in the city. Plenty of seating at the departure gates.,2021-10-09,13:27:25,Mamooty Bhat,fmangold@gmx.de,+49 (0) 9854 696519
We were delayed 2 hours at immigration with long queues of tired passengers. The staff marshalling us into the lines were not interested in providing any comfort or words to ease the frustration. The immigration officials were slow and limited in number to make things worse I realise that the staff were merely doing their jobs and cannot be expected to hurry up the process so I blame the management of the area and the processes involved. If this situation is a continuing one then surely some way of improving the process more staff at peak times for example should be used. The stats for arrivals are no secret the airlines know the figures so why don't the immigration department official do something about it. Or maybe nobody really cares whether we visit again or not!,2021-09-11,19:39:06,Divij Dugar,armaan01@lad.com,+49(0)9119 372361
"Burbank airport is a welcome relief from LAX. It's small and yes does not have the amenities of a large modern airport but those are its strong points.

Having travelled through Colombo 4 times in the last couple of months I can say it is one of the better airports in the sub-continent which is faint praise indeed. The air-conditioning is anaemic the restrooms are only marginally acceptable the duty-free area in the arrivals hall is more like a bazaar with various traders vying for your attention. The drop-off area is over-crowded with people and with vehicles belching diesel fumes. Check- in is a nightmare with long lines and clueless ground staff. On the plus side the terminal is clean and well lit and less crowded past immigration and easy to navigate. Sadly the alterations and additions are very mediocre and the elegance of the original terminal with its colourful fabric ceiling have been long lost.,2021-10-01,04:24:39,Mesut Ditschlerin,cscholtz@web.de,0322-622 09

Both in and out of Dubai airport we had to circle for over half an hour due to heavy traffic making for a very concerning rush to catch our ongoing flight we also had to be bussed to the far outskirts of the concourse to catch our flight home to the UK. It appears that the airport is not able to cope with all the additional flights as a result as Dubai becoming the hub airport for several airlines such as Qantas. I will try to avoid it in the future.,2021-09-28,23:52:18,Eva Holmström,fredriklarsson@samuelsson.com,0334-657 50
It has been vastly improved since 2002 with its complete rebuild featuring the two new terminals. The McNamara terminal used by Delta and its SkyTeam partners continues to impress me since I wrote my previous review in 2006 (below). The distances in the overlong A concourse are covered effortlessly by the tram system and even the long walk to the end of the B and C concourses feature moving walkways along their entire distance. The best architectural feature is the light show tunnel connecting the B and C concourses with the main complex. The new North Terminal extends this welcoming atmosphere to the non-SkyTeam airlines that use the airport. With the exception of one overly rude person the employees have all treated me well here too and the amenities at both terminals are exemplary. Gone are the days of the old terminal system with their horrible congestion and decrepit upkeep. With Detroit's urban decay they might look to the airport for ideas on how to improve things elsewhere in the metropolitan area.,2021-09-27,03:25:57,Sara Lund,riya39@gmail.com,0858362371
I used to like travelling through Brussels Airport : not anymore ! The few last month the airport experience has turned from pleasant to very anoying due to the lack of staff . Lack of staff at check in with Brussels airlines : the airline is trying to force everybody to check on line and the result is long queues at the airport. Lack of staff at boarding pass control : another line before getting to the terminal. Lack of staff at security where now you have to take off shoes every time with rude and bored staff and queues getting longer each month. Altogether a very bad experience and no time left to spend some time and money in the shops.,2021-09-10,06:44:14,Kavya Deshmukh,reyanshsibal@yahoo.com,03092190399
Travelled out and back the same day to Dublin on Aer Arann. Getting dropped off at the airport requires running the gauntlet of the security staff on the approach road - twice we had to stop and tell them we needed to drive to the airport to drop-off. Security seems a bit over the top - especially as they merely waved us on - didn't check the car ask to see my ticket etc... Checked in on-line so avoided the queues - amazed how many security staff are employed. Arrival back later that evening was very different. The airport is no longer allowing cars to pick-up from outside the terminal - instead cars now have to enter the unlit short stay car park down the road from the terminal building and wait for passengers to find them. Not so easy when its dark and raining. After leaving a very chaotic terminal building I had a difficult time trying to find my lift home. The car park being used is unpaved with mud and gravel underfoot - not sure how anyone would manage with a luggage trolley. It requires a walk along the airport road for a couple of hundred yards. Once I had found my lift (could only do this by means of a mobile phone and directions) it took about 10 minutes to exit the car park as cars were not following any type of one way system - reason - no arrows painted on the gravel. I have no idea what the management of this airport are doing here - the airport is a disgrace to Wales (and the UK for that matter) and I would be ashamed of welcoming any visitor into Wales via this airport.,2021-10-04,19:05:32,Aniruddh Boase,alia77@bajwa.com,9098921335
A good airport. Very quickly through security which was staffed by polite people. Passport control queues small and staff dealt with all nationalities in a polite manner. Signs throughout the airport were found to be well positioned and also displayed in English. Over-all this a good airport.,2021-10-05,00:43:40,Eva Karlsson,osama@yahoo.com,+46 (0)860 115 20
"Filthy chaotic poorly managed and miserable. Expected to queue at check-in/bag drop and that was only for 5 minutes but the queue for security had to be seen to be believed and made even worse by ignorant people trying to jump in the queue claiming they only had five minutes (but were then seen the other side drinking). It was then bedlam at the departure gate with two flights ""queuing"" at adjacent gates and incoherent announcements. Such an appalling end to a beautiful holiday. Airports should be clean there should be soap toilet paper and regular emptying of bins in toilets and proper organisation at security and departure gates all of which was sorely lacking at Catania.",2021-09-15,00:51:09,Zaina Chad,tornqvistlinnea@googlemail.com,4642640575
I agree with both previous comments. Although my most local airport I used it for the first time only this week to fly out to LUX via AMS (with KLM) then back from BRU via LHR (with BMI). I was on the road barely 10 minutes after landing on my return (hand baggage only) but had some trouble checking in at Brussels where the staff still referred to the airport as Teesside then again passing through passport control at Heathrow when I gave Teesside as my destination and was told somewhat sharply (and lacking any humour in tone or body language) by the man on the desk that there was no such place! Seriously road signs must be a real pain for strangers to the area - why on earth can't quick stick-on amendments have been made by now? Overall however a pleasantly small and efficient operation - although like Leeds/Bradford (of which in many ways this is a smaller version) passengers will need to be prepared to get very wet and/or cold when joining or leaving aircraft in poor weather.,2021-10-09,11:45:24,Saanvi Talwar,anderssonellen@andersson.se,+49(0)7419 44477
Great airport I hope too many other travellers don't discover it for a while. Have used DTM a few times in the last year and it's quick and easy to use for both arrivals and departures. Security is very quick with lots of staff on hand and although airside facilities are a little limited it's not an issue as you don't need to spend much time there. Arriving is a breeze I'm always off the plane and leaving with my luggage within 10-15 mins. If only other airports were as efficient and pleasant to use.,2021-09-14,21:14:55,Jonas Jensen,aandersson@spray.se,5373384302
In short Delhi airport has been a short and a sweet experience for me in comparison to other airports around the world that look more like a shopping complex than an airport. In my experience it took me less than 30 mins to get out of the airport not a single queue until luggage collection point. I like departures security at the airport gates do not allow any unnecessary people to enter the airport except travellers. Staff helpful and friendly. At check-in they provide help with your luggage. Before you go for immigration there are at three points where you are told about immigration forms. A short and a nice collection of duty free with food court.,2021-10-05,19:29:36,Aaryahi Sarna,udo17@web.de,4059389789

I have used DEN 3 times and every time it has been a pleasant experience. Signage has been no problem throughout the terminal and I have always been able to find my way without any problems. The terminal has spacious concourses and it seems to be able to handle the considerable passenger load better than most airports of its size and traffic volume. Some of the carpeting in the terminal is getting a bit faded but the upkeep is very good overall. The security personnel had serious but professional manners and the lines were reasonably short. The distance to downtown Denver is a bit long but not unreasonable (many cities have longer distances).,2021-09-17,07:03:03,Nancy van der Dussen B.Sc.,ingrid82@johansson.com,+49 (0) 0797 392002
Terminal 3. Passed through Delhi on my way from the US to a domestic Indian destination. As an overseas Indian I can honestly say this facility makes me proud of my home country. The terminal is ultra modern to and very efficient. Immigration at the airport took me a maximum of 5-10 minutes the shopping is excellent as are the restaurants. Bathrooms are kept extremely clean by staff who are always in the bathrooms to clean up after individual passengers. The staff from the immigration officials to the airline staff are professional and helpful. This airport is up to international standards - a pleasure to fly both in and out of.,2021-09-13,02:27:38,Aysel Sölzer,pandersson@lindahl.se,03385268013
All flights T3. Arrived from Narita and straight into a full security check which seemed bizarre. Transferring on SAS to Manchester. No seating outside departure lounge so bodies sitting/lying in the corridors. Flight display outside gate not working so fingers crossed no change to gate prior to flight. Quite a bit of renovations going on nice wooden floors going in hopefully some seating too. 3 weeks later arrived from Heathrow landed at 1700 caught the 1736 train to Malmo after clearing immigration and baggage control.,2021-09-27,21:59:29,Agathe Kabus,hjohansson@karlsson.se,09000 857812
Fly out of somewhere else if possible. I live in Jacksonville FL and took a recent trip to Costa Rica. It was much cheaper to fly out of this airport and did not have to switch planes. So I drove 5 hours. On departure the airport is old and overcrowded not enough seats in the terminal. The airline was late arriving which made things worse. However this was nothing. Upon arrival on a Saturday at 12.30 pm from Costa Rica the real fun starts. After debarkation we waited about 20 minutes to go through a self serve customs kiosk which scans your passport and takes your photo then another 20 min having a live custom agent do the same thing ok so still not too bad then down to baggage bags arrived quick then after getting your bag you have to again go through customs and have your passport checked even though you have done this twice already. This line of several hundred people was wrapped all around baggage claim. They do not look through your bags just checking your passport for the third time it makes no sense oh and there is an airport employee running around telling you not to use your cell phones in baggage claim or 500$ fine.,2021-10-03,15:45:08,Alf Holmberg,mariafransson@johansson.com,03024823691
I flew to CMB from Doha and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the airport. I was through immigration and out of the airport in less than 30 minutes. The touts are numerous and best avoided. Outbound check-in area was nice and spacious. The duty free shops and restaurants are plentiful and toilet facilities clean.

There are good and bad points for CFU. The major change is the attitude of the staff - obviously the Greek economic crisis has made the staff worried about their jobs but they are not winning friends with a 'why are you coming to our airport' attitude .

Once again the most horrendous experience at Edinburgh airport. I have travelled through this airport at least twice a week for the last 6 years and the recent changes to security (and staff) has now made this the worst airport I have travelled through. This morning (Monday 18/5/15) they had again deliberately closed off the perfectly working escalators and lifts that would take you up to join the security queue. Customers could only access via the stairs but this morning the new rule was that a member of staff had blocked these off and was only letting customers through whose flight was within the next hour the rest had to join another queue in the check in area to be called later and this is just to get you up to the queues of the security area. The situation once up there has got worse and worse with the new tray and queuing system. As many other reviews mention some of the staff here are aggressive rude and behave absolutely inappropriately. I even saw one male security staff member deliberately hold back a customers tray (once the customer had left his belongings on the belt) so that he would be delayed further. This morning people were missing flights many were distressed older customers had to use stairs they couldn't manage I think this is an embarrassment to the fantastic city of Edinburgh and to the airport management team.,2021-10-03,13:26:38,Ing.

Well having recently traveled through Henri Coanda airport I found that there is not much before you go through security but when you are there is quite a few shops although for some unknown reason in duty free they will not accept the local currency which is the first airport I have come across that does not. In the international terminal is the Oasis self service restaurant I went to purchase a couple of drinks and I only had a couple of 100 Lei notes left the girl on the checkout went round other staff checking it was okay and not a forgery it was simply an unused note I was then asked to pay by card. I took the note back and changed it at a money exchange with no problem whatsoever and returned to pay for my drinks. When in the queue a passport control officer paid for his drink with no problem and when I mentioned it he was so rude but as I was going to go through to depart what can I say would I use this restaurant again definitely not. Would I return to Bucharest again probably not.,2021-09-26,10:24:56,Dr. Tania Eckbauer B.A.,renekitzmann@davids.de,028-239 95 98

"I don't normally do reviews but felt compelled to do this one after last night's experience at Dublin Terminal 1. I checked in for my flight about 1+1/2 hours before take off at 19.40pm. Going through check-in was a breeze but at security it was a nightmare. At the entrance to security are automatic doors which appear very new. At this point there was a little uniformed man barking out instructions to travellers like an RSM ""don't step beyond the yellow lines! wait your turn etc"". Passing though the automatic barriers you then had a very long zig zag queue of travellers. At this point I would hazard that about 45 mins had passed. If you had left it late as some passengers had you were going to miss your flight. The last section as always was the best bit and you had options which queue to join?! If like me you just accept that the queue you join will always be the slowest then no problem but if you're in a hurry! I got through okay and made my flight which fortunately had been delayed by 35 minutes. I am certain that many people missed their flights last night because of the delays in security. I think there is room for improvement at Dublin Terminal 1 but in the meantime would suggest that travellers check in early for flights.",2021-09-25,19:11:51,Antonio Römer,claus96@walter.com,05206139178

Used the Cairns domestic terminal recently. The arrivals area and baggage claim is a dump but the ticketing/check-in area and the departures area isn't bad. There's not much in the way of shopping or restaurants if you have time to kill and the seating areas are rather limited. The Qantas lounge is pretty decent and best of all it's a very short walk (just a couple of hundred feet) from the baggage claim to the taxi stand and about the same from the passenger drop-off area to the terminal entrance on arrival - though this makes the A$4 baggage cart rental fee a big rip-off. Taxis are also reasonably priced to the city despite the long distance.,2021-09-28,21:06:40,Gustav Holmberg,carl59@swipnet.se,1077691225
Little short of a shambles recently. Took over 90 minutes to get a BA 747 through immigration which meant that getting a connecting flight was touch and go. What made it a lot worse was that connecting passengers do not stay in a secure area but have to go through security again. On top of this the air con was so poor that the terminals were unpleasantly warm.,2021-09-22,16:41:43,Gerda Säuberlich,wmane@gmail.com,8739169921

Calgary Airport has an excellent assortment of shops and services. I was there for 4 hours one morning because of a flight delay. The general public has access to a food fair airplane model store Virgin records Purdy's Chocolates to name a few. It definitely has more to offer than Vancouver or Alberta's provincial capital Edmonton's lousy airport. No wonder Calgary gets the bulk of Alberta's air traffic. I enjoyed the large windows to view arriving and departing aircraft. The FIDS screens are colourful and easy to understand.,2021-09-21,20:16:00,Keya Suresh,andreas38@karlsson.org,03623408061
"The management of this airport obviously believes that ""queuing is good for you"". Try to depart from here in the early hours and you are met with an obstructed main entrance to the departure area where you first have to pass your luggage through x-ray machines. Then you get to the departure hall which is separated from the check-in area by - you guessed it - more x-ray machines. Perversely only one x-ray machine was working when I flew out so the queue was horrendous and completely disorganized. Surely this could be easy to handle particularly now that visitors to Sri Lanka who previously obtained an entry stamp in their passports now have to pay for a visa on arrival. Where is that money going? Another annoying feature of this airport are immigration officials who are clearly chatting away to friends or family on their mobiles while on duty behind the immigration desks.",2021-09-30,16:19:17,Robin Persson,elakshi22@gmail.com,01657326411
I wonder if Guy Liardet went through the same airport as I did? It was a shambles. Check-in was fine but the problems arose at baggage screening and immigration. It took an hour to clear those two obstacles as the security guard could not recognize two books in my suitcase and I therefore had to open my case and in the next queue airport staff were not checking that departing passengers had completed their exit slips for immigration and as a result many had to fill them in in front of the immigration officers meaning that it took 5 minutes to see two people. So by the time security had been cleared we had to go straight to boarding. No time for lounges duty free or anything.,2021-10-04,08:16:04,Walfried Möchlichen,ragnar28@nilsson.com,0451-42 64 39

Late evening check in for my FRA bound flight took 3 minutes. This is a remarkable fact since this is prime time at EZE airport with many long haul flights departing for SE Asia the Americas and Europe. No need any more to go to another window to pay the mandatory airport tax which saves some minutes/hassle. This is included in your fare if ticket has been purchased after March 2009. No queues/delays at security. Even when at least 100 people where waiting in line for passport control it took no more than 10 minutes in an ever moving queue since all 20 booths were manned and moving fast.

Immigration quickly cleared and baggage quickly appeared. Travel into the city is a nightmare - the road network is wholly inadequate for a developing city. Check in for returning flight was quick with no queue but then very long wait at security probably due to heightened measures ahead of the NATO summit.

I have been traveling to this airport for over 20 years and they have made significant improvements that translate to shorter wait times.

The queues were made less bearable by jobs worth grumpy and disrespectful staff. Officials need to get a grip on the 30-45 min queues at peak time and use Easyjet's methodology of directing passengers to the next available assistant or security point. The staff badly need training. I'm sure there are good staff too but they need to get rid of the unhelpful and incompetent staff that are sending passengers home with sour tastes in their mouths and who may decide on another destination for their next holiday rather than face Faro airport again.,2021-10-01,09:09:32,Karl Sandberg,lindstromaxel@larsson.se,05129322253
We have flown from Cardiff airport for over 30 years. My mother and father used to fly twice a year back and forth between Dublin in the late 50's and early 60's and as a child I flew regularly between Cardiff and Dublin to visit family. As a family I my husband and my two teenage sons have used the airport since 2001. In December 2001 we flew on a day trip to Lapland. In 2006 it was with Thomson to Sanford Florida and experienced no problems. Again in 2008 to Sanford Florida with Monarch. In this occasion we arrived at the airport at 4am for our 7 am flight and didn't check in until 6.15 due to a computer crash. We then used the airport in 2009 to fly to Dublin. We didn't return until 2012 where we flew back to Dublin.

My Homebase airport and of course I'd like to start and to arrive here. But I also want to criticize some points: no free Wlan! I think this is really utterly impossible in the modern world of today! Other thing is when I see the passport control for non-EU citizens its always crowded specially when the noon times airliners from UAE Russia and Turkey (with 777 and A330) arrive. Parking is too expensive! Bus connections could be better. Remaining points are ok. The airport is very clean they solved the problems with the signs and also the gastronomy is very good (but also very expensive!).

Unfortunately I was very disappointed in this airport. For all the traffic they get from cruise ships they should have plenty of money to expand. They need to be triple the size!

Think it only has a dozen flights or so a day exclusively under the Air NZ banner now Freedom Air is being re-amalgamated into Air NZ. It has been well modernised and seems very spacious. It has the advantages of a small airport with short distances plane to terminal to baggage collection and to car park. We were in the car and off within 10 mins of getting off the lane. On departure there is a great upstairs light and airy waiting/eating/ arrivals area with plenty of space and excellent views. There are adequate drinks food and shop. The only downside was that the hire car companies closed quite early so as we were arriving at 9.00 pm we had to persuade friends to come and collect us.,2021-09-27,22:50:45,Falko Hörle,kundashayak@deo.com,+49(0)3778142463
A total circus at the airport immigration wait was not too bad although very unfriendly at the Visa Section. The Porters are a total joke! We ended up with 5 Porters holding onto our two bags and all demanding copious amounts of US dollars for handling them. We found the Porters intimidating to say the least!

Arrived in Guayaquil with Avianca from Bogota last week. The airport is a beautiful and modern structure clean and functional. Immigration was less than professional with the agent being rude and curt. On departure after a very quick check-in I once again faced a less than friendly immigration agent. At least the departure tax is now included in the price of your ticket. Jose Joaquim de Olmedo airport is the only choice for southern Ecuador and if not for the poorly trained personnel it provides a good facility for travelers.

Dubai airport is as expected for any international airport. My complaint would only be the uncaring attitude of the customer service agents at boarding/transit gates. The transit agents premark their surveys (rating themselves excellent) and ask passenger to sign and seal it. When I asked the boarding agent at this gate if my companion and I could get adjacent seats (not 5 rows away) her response was you should have checked in online and selected the seats 24 hrs before. That would be difficult considering I purchased tickets 24 hrs ago and got on their Emirates flight and their agent had selected our seats.,2021-09-25,21:39:54,Azad Agrawal,fdesai@hotmail.com,+46 (0)8 470 214 87
An airport with very basic facilities. Arrival was smooth: I waited for around 15 min for immigration clearance and 10 min for customs clearance (which was ok). In front of visa counter I saw crowds of passengers applying for visa (fortunately I did not need a visa) so if you are flying with a wide-body aircraft and you need a visa it pays to disembark as early as possible so you could proceed to visa counter quickly. The taxi stand outside arrival hall claimed to offer 'govt-regulated' fares to different parts of the city but the list could be ignored as it is pricey. Bargain with drivers. There was an exchange shop at the far end of the arrival hall which offered a relatively better exchange rate - Very similar to the rate in city so if one needs to buy some TZS that's a better option. Departure was more chaotic with the main problem being a lack of any flight information display. You just do not know which lounge is for which flight. There are a few shops in departure lounges but not impressive in particular.,2021-09-24,16:36:00,Margareta Öberg,charvikarpe@bassi.com,0125315675
Wifi only available for 30 minutes. Even that is hard to connect and when you eventually do get connected then the reception keeps dropping. Dubai should work on providing free Wifi all other major and smaller airports do.,2021-10-06,18:44:53,Eckhardt Löffler,kristina02@yahoo.de,08-109 31 71
"Plenty of time to study Corfu Airport as we had a 6 hour delay for the return flight courtesy of easyJet. In some respects it has improved in the intervening period eg. more space in the departure lounge but in others it remains the same eg. rip-off prices for refreshments. Arrival was easy particularly since we were on hand luggage only and there were few other flights at that time. Departure seemed smooth enough too until the delay became apparent. We acted on the advice of previous correspondents and entered through Arrivals but in any case the check-in area was not too crowded. Seeing that the departure lounge had plenty of empty seats we went swiftly to security (short queues) and were through quite quickly. Our online paper boarding ""cards"" did seem to be a cause of some surprise though. We were quite impressed by the security staff who were both pleasant and efficient. I forgot to extract my liquids bag from my hand luggage: it was spotted on the scanner I was asked politely to open my bag and after the contents were inspected I was thanked. On our second passage through having had to go back to the landside restaurant for our free ""light refreshments"" the pencils my wife invariably carries in the top of her socks were spotted and investigated: no one else has ever noticed them on any of our trips abroad. The departure lounge did become crowded at times announcements were hard to hear - partly because of the combined noise of several hundred people but also because of the speed at which many of them were made - and the screens were less than informative or up-to-date. There seemed to be long queues at the food counter and if the prices we saw as we had our free refreshments in the restaurant were any indication the airport must be making a mint (each free pie + bottle of water would have cost 5 euros with a 1.50 euro cover charge on top). Predictably enough our spare unopened bottle of water handed out in the restaurant upstairs then had to be surrendered at security downstairs but the security lady was charming about it. When we returned to the departure lounge after our refreshments it was much quieter and there was room to spread out for the rest of our wait though the metal seats are scarcely comfortable. Also why are they in threes when so many passengers are in couples? Overall a mixture of pluses and minuses but I would give it 3 stars rather than 2 because of the surprisingly positive impression we gained of the security staff.",2021-09-14,22:41:59,Irene Jakobsson,anyavarughese@loke.com,08-914 038 34
The immigration officials were a bit incompetent. Mostly due to lack of familiarity with computers. Airport facilities are fine and I had flown before through the airport. But immigration and customs are not like other US airports. I would avoid it if this is your port of entry because of this. Otherwise domestically it is fine.,2021-09-18,07:42:57,Stuvan Deshpande,bhaminidalal@hotmail.com,+910524738469
Remember my stay here as smooth and a pleasure. Superb view of the airport from several spots which I appreciated. Ground crew put on viking helmets when the Norwegian Air Shuttle came in. Quite a small airport perhaps a bit too small which gives little options for food and other things you might want to purchase. Everything else,2021-10-09,10:58:21,Elvira Nilsson,mannemadhup@hotmail.com,+914407395174
I've only used the domestic portion (I fly via SYD) and while it is small and a bit run-down it's not a bad airport. In addition to the too-tiny baggage carousel the Virgin Blue check-in area needs to be rearranged a bit. The queue for computerized check-in became entangled in the queue for the baggage drop. The computerized check-in area needs to be moved further away. I also appreciated the centralized booking desk for the shuttles to town. On my last trip there I liked the convenience of on-site car rental and return but as with any Australian airport you pay an extra tax on the car that you wouldn't if you rented the car in town.,2021-09-21,16:19:24,Michael Möller,larssonmartin@googlemail.com,06030661943
Arrived in the domestic section in the evening. Bags out quickly no matching of the bag-tag to the baggage receipt as can be the case in other airports. Left on the international side the following morning. Check-in reasonably quick. No waiting for passport control. Security check also quick though followed up by a pat-down. Once airside the food options are limited. The small smoky cafe served very expensive filter coffee at 38RMB (espresso machine broken) but the Udon noodles at 40RMB were excellent. Shopping limited. The Terminal is bright nice and airy though fairly small - only five gates in the international section. When taxiing you get a nice view of the military airport the closest foreigners will get to seeing chinese airforce planes.,2021-10-06,05:49:51,Louise Gustafsson,holm53@hotmail.de,+912666961782
This was our first trip to Bali. Having read some awful reviews before our departure we went with a great deal of apprehension and limited expectations. I must say however that our experience - both arrival and departure - was excellent. When we arrived the total time taken from VOA through immigration baggage collection and customs to the waiting hotel car was just about 15-20 minutes. On our departure we left the hotel early (anticipating long queues and delays) to arrive at the airport some 3 hours before our scheduled departure. The time taken from the time we got out of the car until we reached the departure gates (baggage screening check-in airport tax immigration and security) took us all of 20 minutes or so. Throughout the process we encountered friendly and efficient staff. We thus had a lot of time to spend at the airport and we found the shops restaurants and facilities to be very good. On the whole we had an excellent experience.,2021-09-12,22:03:09,Emmi Gotthard-Davids,asen@sridhar-shukla.com,+49 (0) 1461 252746

Delhi's new Terminal 3 has finally opened. Lots of aerobridges travelators well laid out baggage hall clean toilets - a truly superior experience compared to the old terminal. I wish they could improve the calibre of people at Immigration and it isn't fully ready (lounges and outlets are still being put into place) but it is an international quality terminal.

Emirates are scheduling tighter and tighter connections through DXB. 1 hr 20 mins is simply not doable with traffic delays in the early mornings bussing from remote stands chronically slow transit security rail connections between terminals horrendous walking distances to remote gates and a requirement by Emirates to be at the gate 30 minutes before departure - it's just not possible. Transiting though DXB a few years ago just involved long walks now it's an exhausting and highly stressful undertaking which in future I shall endeavour to avoid by choosing another airline. If Emirates were handling livestock instead of passengers they'd probably lose their licence.,2021-09-12,00:10:02,Leif Larsson,amuelichen@pergande.com,+49 (0) 5486 014577
As an independent traveller I am amazed that company reps seem to have so much control or imply they have control over who waits in and outside the terminal building for flights. The tour companies must take responsibility for their own customers and not interfere with independent travellers. Half of the congestion is caused by the tour operators collecting customers for a number of flights on the same coach meaning many are arriving at the airport well in advance of their required check in time! I travel to Corfu at least twice a year and have done so for the past 10 yrs. The tour operators are causing most of the problems by bringing flights in on basically two transfer days. It has got worse not better over time. What they need to remember is that passengers are their clients and it is they who should be calling the tune not the other way round and certainly passengers should not be herded around like sheep when they pay such prices for their holidays!! The airport and its staff are wonderful. It is clean and tidy everyone is friendly. Scanners were better this May than they have been in the past. Tour companies are the problem!,2021-09-18,06:05:17,Prof. Adelgunde Lindau MBA.,gjungfer@gmail.com,+49(0) 446018635
The new airport a huge improvement from the dated one next door the business class lounge with reasonable amenities from buffet style food and cold beer and juices available from the self serve fridge newspapers in English and free internet available. Comfortable seating with a view to the runway business class check-in very smooth with your own line for security check so no waiting. All in all a well designed modern airport my only gripe is it takes some time waiting for your visa on arrival to process once you get to immigration especially if another flight has arrived there should be more immigration officers on the counters for a smoother flow of passengers.,2021-10-01,15:23:50,Rebecka Friberg,fholzapfel@gmx.de,07774740226
There is a restriction on taking liquids through customs. This is when you go through passport control not when you first enter the airport and have to have your luggage scanned - you are fine to take liquids beyond that point just not through to the other side of passport control. Fine to take sandwiches etc just not drinks - so had to pay 5 lira for a 500 ml bottle of water. Noticed this time that there is even less seating than there was at the beginning of the season which means that if you want a seat you have to sit in the food court areas. We did this and kept getting asked if we were going to buy anything. Take something to eat with you but you just have to grin and bear it to pay the price for a drink if you are desperate.,2021-10-07,16:16:51,Olov Linder,wernerbogdan@web.de,+46 (0)8 039 735 58

A clean modern airport but managed by incompetents. It took 2.5hrs from entering the airport to getting into the departure lounge. Increased security is the excuse but it does boil down to very bad management. Massive queues in the initial security re luggage (45 minutes)  check in with Qatar was fairly quick (15 minutes) followed by very slow moving long queues at immigration control with staff working at a snail's pace ( 60 minutes) followed by personal and hand luggage security checks (30 minutes which involved manual tick sheets where each passenger had to be marked off involving 3 staff collectively looking down a list. As a frequent traveller I see many airports and this has to be the slowest and most badly managed airports.,2021-10-05,09:59:33,Ana Schottin-Schleich,zitakranz@googlemail.com,01891509204
This Airport especially late at night at the international departures is now overloaded with passengers taking flights that the queues have become horrendous both at the first security check before you get to the check in. The it takes 45 mins now just to clear immigration & another 15-20mins to go through another security check before you reach your gate. Now plans are in place to expand the international terminal & at this time of night its like a zoo.

I used Nagoya as a transit airport between Indonesia and USA. Quick arrival procedures. Everything was well signed in Japanese and English. Transfer desk was unmanned but I bypassed as I already had boarding pass for connecting flight. Security was fast and polite. Terminal was clean and orderly. My flight was delayed by 10 hours. Terminal has high ceilings and big windows looking out over ramp providing an open feeling. Clean restrooms. Only 1 restaurant which only takes Japanese Yen and a Starbucks but there are several money exchange booths. I did not find an ATM anywhere. Lots of duty-free and high-end shops but only one very poorly stocked news stand. Free Internet throughout airport both via wifi and several laptop stations with Ethernet power plugs chair and light.

"Security staff are arrogant with little or no sense of Customer Service. I had a vital piece of equipment confiscated from my luggage on the pretext that it was ""dangerous"". The item was a small roll of soft rubber strip about 150mm diameter. It was a specially made part for a 90 year old vintage car and I told them that. The woman said it was not allowed; I protested that it was soft rubber and could not harm anyone or anything. She called her supervisor who told me it was ""very dangerous"" - his tone was arrogant as well as stupid. So I lost something worth a lot of money.

Dublin airport (now 2 terminals) is one of the strangest airports. Terminal 1 I use a lot. It was designed (and operated as) a multi-storey car park. The access ramps are still there and can be seen when arriving landside (facing the Terminal 2 building) - so no wonder that it has its drawbacks. Pier D light spacious and with some design flaws mainly relating to layout is fairly OK and of international standard though not excellent in any significant way. It is far removed from terminal 1 by curved walkway which does not have enough travelators. On the inside of this curve there is the original (beautifully restored) terminal from 1939. Gates A/C baby changing facilities are well below standard - better off not using them. Another very negative thing is security checks - most of the x-ray machines are often switched off so only part of the capacity is used - they rather see long queues than spend a few euros on efficiency. In this day and age you often have to take off shoes belts etc. There are no spaces to sit and put your shoes back on instead right after security you find yourself in the shopping area. Terminal 2 promises to be better laid out but those flying budget airlines (myself included) will remain stuck with terminal 1. Any complaints about it you should have just paid the higher price for an other airline that flies from the new terminal. Absence of airbridges is on insistence of budget carriers because boarding is quicker without the airbridges and decreases turnaround time. Gates A and C do have airbridges but not used on all flights.Shopping/food value far too expensive. Pier D is a 25-30 minute walk (even if young and fit) - no caddy service no hand luggage trolleys. Other than that Pier D is the more spacious.,2021-09-23,22:34:19,Marianne Persson,rati01@yahoo.com,+46 (0)8 498 135 65
I am always amazed about the poor quality of Brussels Zaventem airport. Whereas departures may go smoothly arrivals are a nightmare. Luggage takes average up to 40 minutes after landing in the best case whereas airports much bigger such as HKG Singapore and Barcelona who manage to deliver them by the time you get to the carrousel. Luggage delivery is unorganized and usually a big mess.

Although Calgary’s airport is not nearly at the level of Canada's gateway international airports of Toronto and Vancouver. They have a very nice small airport on the Canadian prairies.

Into and out of Corfu on late night flights before the main season started so we had no problems with crowds or queuing. Travelling with hand luggage only made things even easier. Passport control in either direction was very casual to say the least but security on departure seemed reasonably thorough without causing any serious holdups. We only bought a bottle of water airside as we know buying anything at Corfu airport can be expensive. Only one agent to handle boarding for our flight but she got us through the gate swiftly and efficiently. All in all this passage through CFU was almost a breeze compared with our last two trips when we experienced long delays before departure.,2021-09-28,08:56:28,Bhavin Kale,elzbieta49@kranz.de,1755986118

I regularly fly to Delhi Airport. It is an excellent airport with many facilities available. T3 is a lot better than the old airport. Signage is clear and present in all areas of the airport. There are also lots of screens showing flight departures/arrivals. Bathrooms are found in all corners and are extremely clean. A lot of seating is available and there are a lot of shops present at the terminal. Delhi Duty free is very good - lots of products are available. Many good restaurants are in the terminal - serving Indian and international food. however immigrations queues are extremely long and can be a pain. security is also tedious and security staff can often be quite unpleasant.

Dreadfully long wait on arrival at Denpasar airport. It was pandemonium with many flights arriving on a Friday afternoon and only 4 immigration counters open. Waited in the queues for over two and a half hours - hot and uncomfortable with young children and the elderly particularly suffering. Needs crowd control to organise the traffic of the public as people forgot their manners and queue etiquette went out the window in the stifling conditions. Not good enough considering the enormous amount of tourists providing Bali with an economy. However departure was a much smoother process.,2021-09-19,22:21:27,Dipl.-Ing.

This airport is the worst I have ever been too. On arrival it is common for immigration waits of 2-3 hours. These queues are deliberate so that you pay the 'express fee' i.e. a bribe to avoid the queue. This airport is a disgrace. It has just been built but already there are not enough seats for outgoing passengers.

Arrived at 3pm on 03-09 from Amsterdam via Hong Kong together with other flights from Australia. Queuing for a visa was quick but rather long for immigration- over an hour. The question is do we want all airports to be like Singapore-Changi? I definitely do not as this is what all travelling is about experiencing different cultures and circumstances.

Have travelled a few times through T3 and every time the experience has been quite good and hassle-free. This time arrived at 5.30 am from Helsinki and connected to an Air India domestic at 9 am. Bags were out quickly and immigration was a breeze then quickly upstairs to Air India departures with a security check on the way upstairs - we were at the Air India counter by 6.30 am and had plenty of time until AI departure that was on time. The same story on the way back to Helsinki: easy and hassle-free. Maybe this is due to the fact that Finnair lands in Delhi in the morning instead of midnight and takes off at 10.45 am when there is not that much international traffic at T3. Moreover there are some pleasant eateries and cafes there plus great views to the runways to do some plane spotting. Cannot understand some very negative feedback from fellow travellers about Delhi Int'l Airport. Sure Delhi cannot compete with Hong Kong Singapore Changi KLIA or Bangkok Suvarnabhumi but it's still modern bright rather functional and clean. Security is tight but when you know this beforehand you shouldn't encounter any major problems at Delhi Int'l Airport.,2021-09-19,08:04:24,Krish Vala,kaira19@hotmail.com,05326359232
"Terminal 2 is very modern with plenty of places to eat, particularly before security. The walks are short to the gates in T2 and toilets are modern and clean. Security queue times are relatively short and staff friendly and helpful. Terminal 1 is older and mostly good. There is a lack of places to eat in T1 but a new food market area is apparently opening in August. Walks to the gates in T1 are long compared to T2, particularly for Ryanair flights (Pier 1). Pier 1 is modern and clean but is basic in terms of facilities. The walk to Pier 3 is short but it is old and a bit grotty now.  The airport WiFi is the best airport WiFi I've used.

Turkish tourist authorities should be investigating the crooks who run this airport. Worse was the toilets - disgusting is a polite description. We used the Ladies and Gents on the way in once and twice each before leaving not a pleasant experience. Each had one electric hand dryer - none working no paper towels in dispenser no soap in any dispensers I used one cubicle - no paper excrement stains under/around seat (obviously never lifted and cleaned properly and allowed to build up as a hard stain). That was our experience across 5 separate WC's. Perhaps two reasons not to visit Turkey via this dump - cost and hygiene. This part of Turkey is now off our list for a revisit!,2021-10-08,05:43:35,Elisabeth Malm,cedlund@live.se,08-42 10 64
"This airport has a very bad attitude to travellers who need to wait overnight. My wife and I had an early flight and could not check-in online so had to arrive at a time when it would have been pointless to book a hotel room. We were not the only ones in this situation but all of us were herded to the most draughty place in the terminal and forced to sit on uncomfortable metal seats all night even though there were more comfortable seats nearby. We could have paid to use a ""lounge"" area but on investigation this was found to be a dark dingy airless space barely more comfortable than in the terminal. A security check was carried out on all those waiting and we were issued with wristbands so restricting our comfort in this way is completely unreasonable. Some passengers tried to get some sleep laying on the floor but were woken up and forced to move by the security staff. The excuse for this? We would be safer if there was another earthquake! What spurious rubbish. Shame on you Christchurch Airport.",2021-09-28,08:41:09,Suhana Kuruvilla,lgill@yahoo.com,0958-221 91

I arrived almost five hours prior my flight thinking I would have time to shop and eat dinner. It took me up to 2.5 hours to check in to AA. The airport was crowded. There was a strike on the way to the airport and many people came late. After that almost 1.5 hours to pass security line. There are some nice stores in the duty free. The airport is small considering the volume of passengers and old but well maintained.,2021-10-09,16:07:25,Karl Hansen,friedhilde00@hornich.org,0403615955
It's a great small airport but now outgrowing its terminal building. Given that more than one million people a year are using the airport there is an urgent need to build a larger building with superior and more varied shopping facilities to accommodate that extra trade. The terminal building at Guernsey airport is perhaps what Exeter should be aiming for.,2021-10-01,15:24:35,Vidur Keer,svenssonjorgen@hagstrom.com,+912736076286
My first connection flight thru Detroit. I sat business from Frankfurt so I was early off the plane to immigration. That part was handled virtually in 5 minutes. Very empty friendly staff - have seen that different in other US hubs. We had a delay ex Frankfurt I still managed my connection within less than 30 minutes between both flights. The facilities seemed to be ok. I had hardly any time to look around. Looks like an airport you can stand a layover.,2021-10-03,03:52:49,Sven Gustafsson,raghavthakur@gmail.com,+912960526616
Flew into Canberra on Virgin at 8.40am on a wet Friday morning 25/8. Virgin uses common user area and was only flight there. Bags off very quickly as lightly loaded flight and majority of passengers only had hand luggage. Rental car desks easy to locate and terminal well sign posted . About a 200m walk to rental car area mainly under cover. Arrival was all in all quick and efficient. Noted signs and announcements for bus service to city centre $7 one way or $12 return with service every half hour is quite good. Departure again very easy as not many Virgin flights in and out of Canberra. Warning - Check gate number carefully as Qantas use seperate departure area from others and they are not connected! Why they dont connect them is beyond me as it would save money by not having to double up on security staff and shop staff! Bar/snack counter in Common user area doesn't open until one hour before flight so if you are early stay landside if you want to eat or drink!. Terminal clean and bright with good view of apron area. Canberra is an efficient airport coping well with its current number of pasengers.,2021-10-06,06:09:17,Zeeshan Yohannan,duttemir@hotmail.com,5415665251
It is well laid out and things are generally close together avoiding the requirement to walk vast distances to get to/from your gate. There are good amenities available once you're past security if you want to get something to read or something to eat. And the Air Canada lounge at Edmonton is very nice indeed -- definitely the place to be if you have to spend a few hours between flights. The airport is a way out of Edmonton proper and getting there involves a slow drive through downtown if you're from the north side. Also in my most recent trip there it took about forty minutes to get through the security checks. I had allowed what should have been plenty of time before my flight boarded but it ended up being barely enough. I don't know if my experience is the normal situation but if it is the security facilities and staff should be beefed up to handle the amount of traffic.,2021-10-09,14:55:30,Dr. Stefanie Schwital,anna91@eckbauer.de,2777969429
I flew from MME for the first time in almost a year largely because the cost of KLM tickets to a long haul destination have for some reason become more expensive than their equivalents from MAN. This time however there was only about a £60 difference between the MME-AMS-SEA-BUR flight compared to going from MAN and I thought that was worth paying for the convenience and absence of queues that MME offers. On the outward trip at least it was. Apart from the KLM flight I boarded there was almost no traffic at all (I get the impression the loss of charter and holiday flights due to the recession must have hit MME hard) and it remains one of the most stress-free airports I've ever used. There was one irritation. The Iceland volcano business started while I was away as a result of which my return was delayed by four days. While I was away I emailed MME telling them that my car would overstay its paid-in-advance booking in the airport car park asking them not to clamp it or have it towed away and asking if I'd be liable for any extra charge. Don't worry your car is safe and no extra charge came a very quick reply. However when I did return there were no airport staff around anywhere to get my ticket validated and I had to pay an extra £38 in the machine to get out of the car park. I later wrote to the airport enclosing the receipt and asking if they'd consider refunding me. It's now two months later and I've had no reply. Admittedly this is a very minor problem compared to the volcano disruption some people experienced but given that MME must be having real problems retaining routes and passengers (not surprising given how much the cost of KLM flights from the airport have gone up) I didn't find that very impressive,2021-09-27,02:32:44,Mohanlal Dani,knappereinhild@schacht.org,009-106 22 21
Arrived from Dulles on Delta. A reasonable walk under the tunnel to the reclaim area. Bags arrived in good time and a short walk to the car park. I was out of the airport 30 mins after landing. Departure to Baltimore from McNamara Terminal. Checked in using self service machines easy to use. Bag drop quick and efficient many desks open so no queue. Security efficient. Walked to our gate but you could take the fast train a good food court and bar near gates A70.,2021-10-04,11:48:24,John Björklund,gdanielsson@hakansson.org,0832-459 74
I flew into Douala on Swiss and departed on Virgin Nigeria. Both experiences were quite pleasant. I had only hand luggage and was in and out of the airport quite quickly. When departing we waited at the gate which was quite calm and cool. Yes its a bit manic as you walk out of the airport with people and noise everywhere but lots of places are like that.

Of all the airports I've been to both domestic and internationally FLL ranks at the bottom of the list. While I had no problems getting in or out processing through security or boarding or de-boarding the plane it is the airport itself which has no personality or amenities for passengers. For someone with a few hours to kill you need more than two massive overly crowded food courts. Here all they offer are two food and drink areas both massively packed. I was relegated to five chicken strips and a domestic beer standing up while eating (no where to sit) for about $15. Most airports have many different areas like several basic food areas more upscale options and several more sports pub/bar areas. Not here it is all thrown into one area with confusing cafeteria style lines and nowhere to sit. I would avoid this airport at all costs. My home airport LAX is a joke but seems like a luxury compared to this place.,2021-09-11,13:35:16,Ernst Lundgren,dubefaiyaz@kohli.net,03710260500

Used Mactan-Cebu International Airport Sept 2nd 2010 close to 12 midday (incoming) and Sept 22 2010 and again around 12 midday (outgoing). Small yes but I liked that. Very few shops. After check in and passing customs and all that it was no problem of leaving airport building to smoke a ciggy. Plus be aware you have to pay PHP 550 on departure (airport tax?). What struck me most as odd that upon arrival there was no soul in arrivals. I've learned that in case you have no plane ticket you can not enter airport building. So those who will pick you up are outside the airport building waiting for you. On both occasions I did not experience any hassles.,2021-09-26,06:08:19,Ljubica Kabus,swen19@meister.de,+49 (0) 1344 803290

Terminal 3 departure area to fairly quiet. Immigration was very smooth at least a dozen counters open for tourists and I was through in about 10 minutes. The rest of the terminal was in excellent condition and at least half the shops were completed and open for business.

Casablanca Airport is a huge surprise. I had expected something less fanciful only to meet a well run and neat airport. Clearing customs in a large bright room lit by natural sunlight is comforting. It is a little darker at baggage claim and the arrival hall is more sombre than the departure. There are some money changers and unfortunately along came the touts as well. The train station is right below the airport and train service is 1 train per hour into the city (30-40 mins). The International Departure Hall on the other hand is modern bright and spiffy and again clearing customs is a breeze. My only grouse - the check-in rows and customs are far apart so a fair bit of walking is involved. The gates are clearly marked and easy to get to and eateries and cafes are fairly easily located.,2021-10-07,03:03:27,Charles Klotz B.Eng.,hagstromtord@jonsson.com,+49 (0) 1056 698657
"The new airport is aesthetically pleasing and impressive. However the airport is yet to be completely finished with shops still in the process of being built with incessant hammering and drilling. Duty free shops expensive and selection is not extensive. Ground airport staff need to be trained to be more professional and take responsibility to answer queries rather than just shrugging and answering in the negative more often than not. The airport boasts wi- fi access but this is only available to pax with Indian mobile connections and not available to those with international ones. On enquiring about this wi-fi issue a senior staff member answered ""Its your problem not mine"" - very customer friendly indeed. Overall a nice airport good for spending an hour or two but frankly I am bored of it already. It is one of South Asia's better airports - but dont compare it to Changi or HKIA Indira Gandhi Intl does not come close to either of the two.",2021-09-10,07:00:44,Adina Ladeck-Rogner,damini20@sandal-bhalla.info,(06575) 961616
Terribly congested airport especially ski resort changeover delays. Always delays as only limited capacity for airliners in landing parking weight restrictions etc. Cant find seats no room to sit on floors litter everywhere toilets overflowing with urine no proper information and facilities unable to cope. A usual Saturday experience according to our Crystal rep. This airport is a health and safety disaster. Travel companies should put pressure on Chambery authorities to expand and improve facilities. Until then use elsewhere - Grenoble Lyons or Geneva or try other countries as it is a horrible experience.,2021-10-07,10:15:53,Faiyaz Rattan,pbeier@hotmail.de,+917165611144
For a very small airport in a poor African country its really not bad. The departure hall is relatively spacious with plenty of seats a decent cafeteria and restaurant and a good selection of souvenir shops and there's even a bc lounge (not sure if its for a certain airline). The arrival area is less nice. It is below the departure area and looks like just a concrete basement area. Neither level is fully enclosed and especially on the arrivals level which opens directly outside (no doors) there will probably be mosquitos etc. inside. There is a foreign curency exchange offering the same rates as those in the city. There isn't really any public transport (unless you count the dalla-dallas (minibuses) on the highway outside which will undoubtedly be impossible to board with any luggage) but as soon as you exit if no one meets you you're likely to have taxi drivers approaching you from all directions (don't pay more than 10000tsh (about $9).,2021-10-08,09:10:14,Madhup Keer,rlarsson@olofsson.org,+49(0)8796 889965

Like some of the other reviewers here I'm a Canadian that uses BUF as an alternative to Toronto Pearson International. The reason is simple - - for flights within the United States it's vastly cheaper to fly from Buffalo -- On one occasion recently I was able to make a flight out of Buffalo for literally half what it would have cost from Toronto (all taxes included). Two significant reasons why Buffalo is cheaper -- Firstly Pearson charges possibly the highest landing fees in the world and second the United States TSA charges higher security fees for trans-border versus U.S. domestic flights. One review of Buffalo Airport complained about it being hard to fly anywhere direct from Buffalo but I suspect that most airports are like that these days. With one connection you can get to most places from Buffalo. My one issue with the airport is that it was designed in the pre-9/11 era and nearly all the airport facilities (stores restaurants etc.) are in the secure area so there isn't much to do for people waiting for arriving flights.,2021-10-05,09:32:08,Jerzy Wulff,dietrich55@saeuberlich.com,05117451174
Great airport. Ideal if you are connecting to the United States. There are lots of services shops and restaurants. Easy to spend time during a connection.

Once you are actually in the airport it's lovely. Getting to the airport however is not nearly as pleasant. Flew in and out of Denver in June 2012. On the return from the time we arrived at the rental car return lot it took 45 minutes to get to the gate and the security line was just a couple of minutes. The car rental lots are a long bus ride from the terminal and if you are returning to Terminal West there's now a detour. If you don't need to check in take a bus to Terminal East if you can. Car rental prices at DIA are much higher than in Denver and the taxes are fees are very high - about 25%. If you can pick up your rental car downtown - admittedly not very practical with the transit options to downtown you can save a lot of money. I'm sure the airport works well for connections - but watch out for thunderstorm delays in summer - but for actually visiting Denver it's not very convenient.,2021-10-09,22:18:06,Joseph Kranz-Sauer,mishasaini@sandal-shankar.com,(02814) 291318
After reading all the reviews I was expecting the absolute worse. Landed on a Saturday evening and overall took Due for a 2.45 arrival on a Thursday landing delayed as we had to sit in a holding pattern for over 30 mins. 1.5hr wait to get through immigration word is that you can't purchase the VIP pass anymore to get through quicker but you can go up to someone and pay then and there if they are in a good mood. I was already 4 lines into my wait when I found this out so didn't want to risk it. Flying business or having premium FF gets you nothing on arrival at this airport every foreigner queues together. On top of all of that took an hour to get to Seminyak. Departure was a completely different story. 20 min drive from same Seminyak location at 6pm on a Monday. Waited 5 mins at priority check in (here I was provided an entry card to the temporary lounge) around the same to pay the departure tax (yes it's annoying but most if not all other imports have this it's just built into the taxes when you book your flights!) then maybe 15 mins at immigration? In there there's also 2 security check points that had less than a 3 min wait. Decent sized duty free but pricey from what I saw (alcohol in Australian airports is cheaper). The temp lounge was packed could probably fit 100 or so people seated. Food selection consisted of sandwiches vegetables soups fried rice salads and some fruit. Refreshments include sodas water beer and wine as well as hot drinks. Severe lack of power points which seems to be a growing trend these days. I walked past 3 food outlets to get to the lounge but can't comment on the quality or selection. If is written this review based purely on arrival you'd see 1 star but I'll bump it up a bit because of my departure experience.,2021-09-30,23:22:26,Shlok Kale,ytaneja@yahoo.com,06480 62133
I've read some of the critical reviews on this site and while Brussels airport is not the best airport I know I believe things have got better lately. The frequency of trains to and from the airport has increased some trains are still the old shuttle trains from Brussels but others are the very reasonable longer distance trains running through Belgium. The roadworks close to the airport are over. But more roadworks could be planned. The departure hall can be crowded but some low cost flights are now handled in a separate extension of the departure hall making room in the rest of the airport. The Schengen gates used to be accessible via a long underground tunnel with lots of escalators. These have gone now: there is a new 'connector' building that is much more pleasant to go to the A gates. The new shops toilets restaurants in the A gates area look nice some restaurants still close relatively early. The non-Schengen gates are less bright but the new connector building now also improves the transfer from A to C gates and vice-versa. On my last visit to the airport my luggage was on the luggage retrieval belt before I got there so zero wait. The arrival hall is still the low-ceiling area it used to be quite unwelcoming.,2021-09-21,20:09:23,Ante Austermühle,mikael30@gmail.com,+49(0)3897477446
Used T5 at O'Hare twice last week coming from and leaving to LHR. The terminal is perfect to perform a terminal's main goal - getting people quickly and efficiently off and on an airplane onto or off a cab/bus/. It took less than 10 minutes to leave the plane pick up my luggage pass immigration (being a non-US citizen) and into a cab. When leaving check-in desks are plenty and gates are only (on average) a 2 minutes walk from security gates (which are next to the check-in desks). Be aware that T5 has no eateries and only very basic duty free. Almost nothing in fact. But as said before T5 is meant to be an arrivals/departure building which works very well and not a shopping mall.,2021-09-18,15:10:36,Anne-Marie Svensson,akarlsson@andersson.org,09070836991
I passed through Terminal 3 when flying from Istanbul to Luxor and was pleasantly surprised. On arrival the visa windows were well signposted and immigration quite efficient. I made my way to the Domestic floor without being hassled by anyone indeed there only seemed to be about a dozen people in the whole Terminal. Quiet clean plenty of places to sit or get coffee water and something to eat. On return from Luxor I just followed the signs for connecting flights and went quickly through security only to find my Egyptair flight to Istanbul was delayed by 55 minutes. But there were shops to look at and decent looking food outlets too.,2021-09-16,03:08:51,Dina Haering,sundqvistniklas@googlemail.com,+912957241207
Passed through BUD Terminal 2B 12 times in the last half year. Check-in usually takes a bit of time and can be extremely crowded so it is good to be there 90 minutes before your flight - except if you have already checked in online. Check-in staff not especially nice or helpful. There is only 4 check-in machine for Malev flights however this is their main hub and those machines are usually out of order or frozen for several minutes. Passing security takes time and they can also be rude. The airside is crowded with good facilities but only a few place to sit - let's hope that this will change with the current enlargement of the terminals. After boarding at peak times we often had to wait 5-10 minutes for the personnel of the airport to push back the plane from the standing position: there is not much capacity reserve for this at BUD. When arriving getting your luggage can take 5 minutes as well as 25 you should just cross your fingers and wait. I miss a central screen in the baggage reclaim area which would show which flight is delivered on which belt.,2021-09-16,01:38:14,Robin Eriksson,fhertrampf@hotmail.de,07177268300
Usual chaotic scenario during peak times with travel reps running here and there to assist . Some car hire depots require a short mini-bus ride but not a problem.

Dundee Airport is very small but has a modern terminal building. Facilities are not suprisingly rather limited but the check-in is very quick and easy. Free parking is available. The only route is the Scot Airways service to London City Airport which operates several times daily. The only negative aspect is the lack of public transport links but a taxi ride to the city centre takes only five minutes. The main Aberdeen-Glasgow railway passes the airport - the lack of a station is annoying. Compared to the long queues and delays at larger airports the tiny Dundee Airport is a delight to use and a useful alternative to Edinburgh or Aberdeen airports. The view of the city and the River Tay on takeoff/landing is stunning.,2021-09-30,10:26:35,Staffan Lindholm,jensoberg@nordin.se,023-84 97 13
When you read some review sites and find negative comments you assume it is due to the reviewer having had bad luck and that it is possibly not that bad. However the reviews here are almost the opposite - most reviews are correct and in fact some almost optimistic. I have been to Dubai airport twice in the last six months and on both occasions Emirates parks 15 minutes away from the terminal and they pack you into a bus and drive you to the terminal. Signage isn't too bad - but why all the security checks? Anyway as described you keep going up and down escalators and finally enter a terribly overcrowded terminal concourse which even at 2am is absolutely packed with passengers. Very difficult to find a seat. There was a queue to use the toilets - but they are clean. How could Emirates expand their flights so much without thinking of airport facilities? It was therefore quite a relief to arrive in Changi Airport Singapore as the next stop. It is such a shame you can't avoid this airport if flying Emirates as Emirates is actually a very good airline.,2021-09-26,19:05:13,Erik Malm,qjessel@kuhl.com,09861299019

"An entirely unpleasant experience all round arriving from London City. Our taxi time on landing took a very long time, which was then compounded by boarding a bus and make a long and crammed journey to the terminal. Had hoped to make up for lost time by grabbing a taxi, but the queue meant the bus was a better option. On departure, whilst the security was not exactly top class prior to the changes made over the past year, it has now become comfortably the worst I've experienced in the past ten years. Only two lanes were open despite a long queue. Those lanes which were open were a complete shambles - the system simply doesn't seem to work. To make a bad situation worse, as others have commented, the staff are extremely abrupt (possibly they are frustrated with the shortcomings of the system they work with, but who really cares?) to the point of being rude. They leave a sour taste and leave an awful final impression of the city/country. I had intended to make a purchase and perhaps buy a sandwich, but the time spent going through security put paid to that. The train or flying into Glasgow certainly seem more attractive options in the future.",2021-10-03,08:47:52,Mats Ljungberg,gardezeeshan@madan.net,05192264116
It is the only airport regionally that people have to use. It is awful: understaffed clerks are rude flights often late or missed because of understaffing and can't make lines. It is customary to have people or entire groups of people get moved up in line in order for them to make their flights. Just plan on having things go wrong if flying through Burlington.,2021-10-08,21:07:37,Ivana Kumer,mona67@arvidsson.org,08-984 879 05
Copenhagen Airport has turned into a shopping centre and has become very poor. So if you want a smooth check-in security control pass immigrations luggage handling by arrival fair prices for parking etc. then avoid Copenhagen Airport! If you live in Denmark or Sweden then don't pay the horrible fees for parking. Public transport to Copenhagen or Malmo/Sweden by rail is fast cheap and comfortable. Check-in be prepared for long lines and crowding - especially if you are travelling economy. Security control long lines and crowding. The security control is absolutely not efficient compared with other airports. E.g. why haven't they established a conveyor belt or tables along the lines so you are able to prepare your jacket belt mobile laptop etc. for scanning while waiting? After the security control don't expect to find information and which gate the flight leaves from. Instead be prepared to disappear in a crowded shopping centre. This is very stressing and you have a very high risk for missing your flight because you can't estimate walking time. And be aware - the prices in the airport is not competitive with shops in Copenhagen. There is not very much public space in the airport (because of all the shops) so be prepared for a long and crowded walking distance to the gate. When arriving to Copenhagen Airport be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes for the luggage handling. Also be prepared for long lines in immigrations.,2021-09-12,06:38:00,Dorothee Niemeier B.Sc.,maria27@yahoo.de,(02765) 45256
This must be one of the worst airports. I travel regularly it is inevitable I stop at Dubai for transit - or when the wait is over 8 hours go out to one of their hotels. You walk a lot when arriving because signs/indications are not clear the info desk staff are useless unfriendly and at times plain arrogant. The space where you walk is narrow and the place simply overcrowded. Security staff are impolite and unfriendly. The queues are too long and procedures redundant.,2021-10-06,21:21:37,Magdalena Abrahamsson,ycarlsson@gmail.com,02942795287
Landed at CUN airport from a flight coming from Montreal. There was at least 30 minutes of waiting to pass passport control probably because there were many flights landing at the same time mostly coming from the USA but my bags were already out.

Brussels to Zurich - The first impression was a disorderly airport and long queues. Not a very appealing interior ill-planned layout of the airport makes you go up and down several times. Not many things to look for while waiting for the flight. This airport is clearly not at par with other European standard airports.,2021-09-29,04:50:45,Alessandro Ring-Stiebitz,ingrid55@gmail.com,05461786773
The airport resulbles a shack. A very bad cafe and unfriendly staff across the whole airport. I will never use this airport again. It is a nightmare even trying to get to this excuse of an airport. My advice to anybody thinking of using this airport use Brussels National insteade.,2021-09-30,03:27:05,Saksham Dyal,vpettersson@googlemail.com,(07724) 504490
Flew into DXB International (T1 with BA) 27 November. No complaints - expected a bit of a wait through Immigration and not too bothered by it as in the end not that long. Luggage also not unduly delayed. Flew out of T1 on BA108 Sunday 8 Dec - was actually pleasantly surprised at how quiet it was. OK - the ground floor is now a retail shopping area but there were plenty of seats upstairs. My wife is a very occasional smoker and even the smoking lounge was relatively nice. Quick and easy bag drop security not unduly long winded so all in all a pleasant experience. Much more so than 4 years ago on our last visit. Maybe when the Al Makhtoum International comes fully on stream things will be even better.,2021-09-17,19:31:22,Aradhya Shah,uthkarshdin@gmail.com,08-523 212 16
I flew to Delhi and then an internal transfer to Amritsar. Rude staff long delays at security and very rude security staff zero customer service. No point having wonderful facilities if the whole process takes so long that you have no time to sit down at the airport! Very stressful. Same story on the way back.,2021-09-19,15:38:18,Susanne Andersson,gandersson@telia.com,8285786558
"I've been flying out of here for 14 years. Anyone saying this airport is hard to navigate is sorely mistaken. How hard is it to follow signs and move between 1 terminal and 3 linear concourses? Even gates on one side odd on the other. There is a healthy amount of people but not too many. Look at website to find restaurants. Security can sometimes be a hassle but look at the website and follow the signs to the less crowded checkpoint. Tip: there is a checkpoint at the end of the bridge to Concourse A. If you don't mind a little walk it is often much faster. To the person who took a wheelchair to gate ""E15"": while I have complete sympathy for your plight with the attendant I must point out that there is in fact no gate E15 at DEN. There has in fact never been a single E gate. US Airways does use gates B15/17 in the Star Alliance B concourse and they are quite far from the train stop. However other gates are farther and the moving walkways significantly reduce this travel for most.",2021-09-26,15:06:14,Saanvi Rastogi,fspiess@johann.com,4676429041
For a brand new airport terminal I was staggered to find out there are absolutely no drinking water fountains and the water in the toilets is not potable. So when you empty your water bottles at the security check point there is no way to refill your bottles before boarding your flight. This is a very handy scam for the shop owners who make a lot of money by selling bottled water. Why they built a new airport terminal without one drinking water fountain beggars belief. Unfortunately like all airports they are monopoly businesses set up to extract as much money as possible from people that must be rich enough to travel therefore no sympathy for them.,2021-09-16,15:03:54,Shalv Mander,mangalsaksham@balay.com,03644879290
"Needed to change airlines and reclaim and recheck luggage here en route to Nampula Mozambique. It was not at all clear which to do first. Consequently we got on the flight to Nampula on LAM but our luggage did not. Other passengers told us that this happens ""most of the time"" on this flight. The problems with baggage appear to originate in the Dar es Salaam terminal. Had it not been for some friendly and helpful staff we might not have gotten through at all.",2021-09-18,23:42:10,Jadwiga Klingelhöfer,bolnbachalexander@gmx.de,+911353617148
An intra-Schengen transit was painless. The facilities were good and I found plentiful seating with good views though I did have to walk a little way from the gate I arrived at and departed from (which were adjacent). I had a snack that was expensive - more so as I did not have any Krone. Generally though a good experience for me.,2021-09-27,18:58:31,Margareta Blomqvist,stavrosloeffler@wohlgemut.org,+49(0) 058005397
My fourth transit through Dubai with Emirates and it may well be my last - masses of people trying to get through security and only 2 stations operating. Emirates hands business class passengers a fast track card but the airport doesn't operate such a facility. No one around to enforce the lines for the stations people pushing from all directions resulting in chaos. Will try Qatar/Doha next time and otherwise resort to Changi again.,2021-09-24,19:54:48,Sergio Hauffer,schuchhardtpetar@pergande.com,+46 (0)8 791 489 19
O'Hare is enormous and always busy but in spite of that it is well organized. The signage is clear and easy to understand. The security line which may look daunting at first moves quickly. Once through any domestic security checkpoint you can access all domestic terminals (1-3). There is a wide variety of places to eat and drink or grab something quick at a broad range of prices. While not a shopping mall like many newer airports there are plenty of places to shop and browse. The Blue line train is an inexpensive and reliable way to get to or from downtown Chicago or its neighborhoods. I use O'Hare regularly and find it as tolerable as any airport - none of which I would describe as pleasant places to spend time. The main complaint I hear is from non-US citizens arriving at the International Terminal (Terminal 5) waiting in very long lines. I have experienced long lines when arriving as a non-citizen at airports around the world so this does not appear to be a problem unique to O'Hare.,2021-09-19,23:46:50,Rabea Boucsein,dhillonritvik@hotmail.com,06782438234
Arrival okay just slow. Departure horrible. Queues long and they must try to employ the rudest staff they can find. Cash only for departure tax and yet no one thought to provide an ATM. Once through had lunch at the closest sit down cafe only to be served an awful club sandwich. No decent food places and nowhere else to sit. Bags opened by security many times and queues for everything. Worst international Airport available. If the staff were at all friendly it would at least make the lack of facilities bearable. Indonesia should be ashamed of this effort on such a beautiful place.,2021-10-08,17:16:50,Marianne Lundgren,hanslarsson@live.se,+49(0)2994 441058
Christchurch is a nice little airport where you can sit and watch the planes while having something to eat. There is also a viewing deck which is unusual in these days of heightened security. I noticed a useful little play area which seemed to be keeping a lot of children happy. The airport was clean and the staff very polite and friendly.,2021-09-25,12:34:07,Anna Andersson,kaurnirvi@yahoo.com,00205038493
"My experience was pleasant flying from ORD's newly remodelled Terminal 5. No hassles through TSA on the way out and no headaches coming back in. The new shops are lovely but pricey and it was fun passing time in the duty free shop. We did not encounter any rude or indifferent employees. What I liked best about my return through ORD is the passport control process. While the traditional process is still available for US Passports they also offer (at no cost) kiosks that get you through the process much quicker. The kiosks are in the room after TSA's ""Trusted a Traveler"" portals; I made the mistake of trying one of those out first. Baggage and customs were a breeze too. So ORD is now my first choice if I'm flying international.",2021-09-28,14:24:56,Herr Maurice Drub,nayantara14@bhatia-chopra.net,+46 (0)709 948 18
"Cologne airport is one of my favourites whether it's the shiny ultra- modern new terminal or the 1960s ""old"" one which has a cool retro appeal of its own. If you're into architecture you'll enjoy it here. Staff are mostly friendly and chatty the atmosphere is calm and spacious and a good tip is it's got one of the cheapest duty free shops I have found in Europe (whiskey bargains to be had!) what's more at the ""old"" terminal you can walk into the little duty free and buy on LANDING which means if you're coming from the UK and wanting to bring your German friends an alcoholic gift it's by far the best place to pick it up and there never seems to be a queue. Only downside I can think of is that you need to be ready to walk long distances through its large spaces especially if you land at the old terminal and then want to get the bus into Cologne. However the S-Bahn link to the main station has recently been completed it's cheap and quick and at the end of the line lies one of Germany's best and friendliest cities.",2021-09-29,10:28:26,Ingrid Linder,clarsson@yahoo.de,+49 (0) 6579 782296
Arrival - immigration reasonably efficient with average queuing time (10 - 15 minutes for an Airbus 330 load). Baggage return slow - about 30 minutes. Taxi area outside the terminal is chaotic,2021-10-06,11:29:44,Stefan Svensson,margareta81@henck.com,+46 (0)8 931 948 23
Arrived from Dublin to Dubai airport near midnight on business class. The signs were all over the place send you to turn left then turn right all it needed to say was keep going straight. The airport is very badly air conditioned with temperatures near 28 deg c. A nice 24 deg c would be suffice if you are trying to save energy. When we got to customs there was a huge line even though we had business class tickets. We ended waiting 40 minute in line to clear customs. The only bonus is that at least our bags were ready at the carousel as it took so long. Business class all had chauffeurs to drive you to your hotel. Had to wait another 15 min for this. All in all in took 1 hr 30min to leave the airport to the time we touch down. It's not really world class is it?,2021-09-11,14:54:00,Ivan Kota,akaur@yahoo.com,+49(0)1975 79095
We recently used this airport for the first time in 25 years (moved back to Cardiff). Parking was close enough to the terminal to walk and was incredibly cheap. Check-in was no different from any other airport I have ever used and security is no worse either (always a trial anywhere). Prices at the bar and cafe were shocking (more expensive than Heathrow) but you don't have to buy. On our return we were off the plane and in the car within 20 minutes and that was after collecting bags which is pretty good in my experience. Other reviews moan about charges for Pick-up and Drop-off but most UK airports now do this and there is a free area if you wish to use it. It's a shame that there are not more flights but this might cause its own problems with congestion. I desperately want to use my local airport so I hope the management does something to attract more airlines to Cardiff. Cardiff Airport has the potential to be a first class regional hub.,2021-09-12,02:10:34,Miraya Brar,renatemisicher@ullmann.de,0005530775
I have travelled through Edinburgh Airport frequently for the last 10 years and have had no cause for complaint. On three previous (quiet) occasions I have used the new security area without any problem. Departing at 13.10 on Friday 6th of February introduced me to the chaos highlighted in these posts. It is beyond belief that airport management can get so many things so badly wrong all at once. I will be flying from Glasgow in the future.,2021-10-10,11:59:15,Mannat Manda,jiyabajwa@goyal-dani.com,0951-609 87
Avoid if you can. We just returned from there 2 days ago. Unfriendly rude staff. Chaos everywhere. A huge queue to pass security and passport control. Once you finally pass it you find crowds of people from about 15 different flights all cramped in a small waiting room and there are only 5 departure gates. My boyfriend and myself wanted to sit next to each other in the waiting area as our flight was in 2 hours. We couldn't find 2 seats next to each other. Children were crying. People pushing each other as there is enough space to even walk around. Only one coffee shop to buy something to drink. Forget if you are hungry. One type of a small sandwich (5 euros!) and it wasn't fresh. Over priced shops.,2021-10-02,15:43:15,Dipl.-Ing. Dunja Rosenow B.Sc.,stiebitzottmar@hotmail.de,+49(0)8170 09320
Pity the first time visitor to Turkey - this is their last memory of a beautiful country! The airport practice of being a complete rip off remains. 8TL (£3+) for a can of pop bearing in mind that they practice a liquid restriction (though we saw evidence to belie this) what kind of profit is this airport now making? Check-in staff were friendly but just not quick enough. The airport was unbearably hot. Entrance scanner staff must have felt that they needed something to do as I was asked to unpack a camcorder and produce passports. Duty Free prices are all in Euros so you can bet your life that you are being fleeced due to a dynamic currency conversion. Having paid more than double UK service station prices for food before we avoided the food court. Smoking restrictions are in place but we couldnt face the journey through the scanners a 2nd time round. A modern building with the capability of being outstanding - what a shame it isn't put to use!,2021-09-29,23:34:54,Eshani Sibal,ljonsson@yahoo.de,(08266) 985785
Poor service dirty windows floors horrible toilets. That airport is the worst in that part of the world. And one of the most expensive. Sadly it's impossible to avoid this place. Not the best gateway to beautiful Bali. We waited 3 hours in the Q for a passport control after arrived. They should try put customers on the first place.,2021-09-15,20:16:06,Erol Ehlert,wgumprich@yahoo.de,09476606022
New airport looks similar to the old one just a bit bigger. Arrival was fine (after some past horrendous experiences we always opt for the express service). The real horror story was departure. Massive queues total chaos. I was timing how long it took them to check in each passenger and no joke the average time was 20 minutes! For each passenger! Flight departed 3 hours late. Flight crew were apologetic saying they were ready to go on time but the incompetents at check in couldn't do their job. Disgrace. Funny thing is departure was ok at the old terminal.,2021-09-17,23:34:49,Biju Singhal,maria17@svensson.com,02362765990
"A pleasant change from LAX and San Diego my home airports. Arrived in transit and had to spend two hours here. As I was looking at a large directory sign I was approached by a very nice lady who wore a tag identifying her as an ""ambassador"" of the airport. She handed me a small map and directory and explained the skylink a free train system the airport has to take you from one terminal to another. It is clearly marked and had signs specifying what terminal the train took you to. The airport was clean had plenty of shops and restaurants and was well organized. I didn't have to pick up baggage or go through customs but the airport itself is one of the better ones I've been in.",2021-09-30,06:36:27,Diya Chauhan,erwin09@web.de,01268187522

Stopped over at this airport twice en route from London to Singapore. Terminal 3 was very busy on my return leg all the ladies toilets in the terminal had queues! On my London to Dubai leg the plane stopped far away from the terminal and we had to take a 20 minute bus to the terminal. The queue to board the Dubai - Singapore Emirates flight was also very messy and chaotic.

I had to use Delhi for domestic and international transfers. The Airport has still got smelly carpet which they need to change. The toilets were clean and better than Heathrow. The security queues at international transfer was really long and as well as the queue for lift to domestic transfers. They need to introduce more lifts to domestic transfers as one lift is not sufficient for international passengers. The food court is impressive and caters for world cuisine. Elderly people have a nightmare at this airport due to long walks. This can be overcome by introducing shuttle services to gates from security gates. The security personal were polite and interactive. Overall I am impressed with Delhi.,2021-10-02,01:46:19,Inge Bäckström,kannanzeeshan@desai.net,00462 937906
This airport is not large enough to handle the amount of passengers that go through it. It has insufficient seating due to the small nature of the terminal. Flights overlap and many passengers have trouble finding seats. Other than the lack of seating the airport is normal. The restrooms are very clean and can accommodate many so queues do not form.,2021-10-10,19:22:20,Jennifer Mentzel-Trubin,sainidivit@bhagat.com,6764655153

This airport is not yet set up to handle large flights and certainly not more than one at any time. They use buses to transport you from the plane to terminal which means de-planing takes a long time. Then you queue for hours to get through the different stages - it seemed like staff were almost creating the chaos by poor judgements and there were just not enough people available to handle the volumes in immigration. Many conversations heard about how it was intentionally bad because they didn't want the cheap airlines but I was horrified by the number of travellers saying they would not come to Florida again - having tried both MIA and FLL and found both to be terribly organised. They should try LAX perhaps for a real chaos but this is terrible for the travel industry and Norwegian who are currently offering good value flights.,2021-09-12,01:00:02,Emilia Rust,fpetersson@spray.se,03179 59232
"Our outbound experience was quite good. Check in took 5 minutes and security was cleared in a similar time. Our return experience was very different. It was pouring with rain when we landed. We had to leave the plane on steps and get on a waiting bus. We were then dropped some distance from the terminal building and left to walk in the rain. The queue for the electronic passport clearance stretched across the entry door making it difficult for people to get in. By the time we did we were soaked along with a couple of hundred other people. I considered asking my wife to wait with the luggage while I ran to the car in long stay 2 but I could not see any obvious place for her to wait so already being very wet we just walked. There is no transport to this car park. When we were ready to leave the car park it took a while to find my way out. There are no ""exit"" arrows and the only ""exit"" sign is actually right next to the exit. It is not high enough to be seen by someone sitting in a car. This happened in daylight. In the dark a person would be left completely at a loss. I will avoid East Midlands from now on.",2021-10-01,00:06:48,Vritika Bakshi,klaus-michael52@gmx.de,+49(0) 700707086
Three hour wait in Terminal 3 in the early hours of the morning. Terribly crowded with all sorts of shops wanting to get their hands on your cash. If you're looking for something to eat and think you might find some interesting Middle Eastern food forget it - Macdonalds and Starbucks is about it unless you want to spend lots of money on seafood and champagne. Toilet provision is terrible - maybe about two or three sets of facilities per gender all with long queues and water sloshing around the cubicle floors. I suppose you have to endure it in order to take advantage of Emirates flights but it's not an enjoyable experience.,2021-09-19,10:10:20,Eva Rajagopal,erikssonalbin@googlemail.com,0753-818 83
I like the service on Emirates flights to and from Asia to UK however every time I dread the transfer at Dubai. Sometimes the walk to the nearest transfer security check feels like a mile. Queues for security are far too long for transfer passengers there is no fast track for first or business passengers - pay a fortune for a first class ticket take part in a scrummage as part of the experience. The signage within the airport is not too good and yes it is always a busy airport. First class lounge is very good though plenty of space free spa facilities good food. Duty free is expensive.,2021-09-30,21:31:31,Tejas Soni,bzimmer@gmail.com,098-40 26 69
Southwest and Jet Blue offer a cheap alternative to us Canadians but airport fees at YYZ adding 80% to a fare is somewhat of an exaggeration. This airport is not a travel friendly place one of the coldest and most impersonal airports I have ever been in. The parking system is quite expensive and very disorganized the shuttle buses wander aimlessly and don't pick up on a first come first served basis. The day we left there were noisy sirens and alarms going off all the time and all the staff just ignored them and my eardrums just hummed and I couldn't hear anything that was going on. While the food sold was good there was very little selection (apart from Burger King before security every outlet had the same menu) and the prices were exorbitant.,2021-09-27,06:20:14,Göran Andersson,navya70@dutt-boase.biz,097-61 47 86
